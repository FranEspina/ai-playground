      "Tokyo-bound Sampson sets Aust rifle record. Shooter Dane Sampson has struck career-best form as he builds towards a third Olympics, setting a national record while winning the 50m rifle event at the South Australia championships. Sampson registered a score of 462 points to claim gold in the three positions event. The performance bettered Sampson's own national record of 460.7 points, which he achieved at last month's Wingfield grand prix. The score was also notably higher than what Italy's Niccolo Campriani (458.8) and Poland's Tomasz Bartnik (460.4) produced to win gold at the 2016 Olympics and 2018 world championships respectively. \"It's good to be shooting PBs at this stage. It was a world-class finals score,\" Sampson said, having previously competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. \"You are unlikely to lose many competitions with that score. \"I definitely feel that I am getting better and better and I am tracking well for Tokyo.\" Sampson and other members of Australia's shooting team for the 2021 Olympics are set to come together for a pre-Games camp on July 4-19.

      "7. What’s your role in AngloGold Ashanti? – Sam Jonah questioned. After his public address to Rotary Club in Accra, Sam Kwesi Esson Jonah KBE, has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the Executive. The latest criticism is coming from Paul Adom-Otchere, host of Good Evening Ghana (GEG), who in his biweekly show on Metro TV, tried to ‘punch holes’ in the senior stateman’s speech. According to him, Sam Jonah KBE, must have had a role in Ashanti Gold which later turned into AngloGold Ashanti, therefore, he should be able to tell the young people of Ghana the role he played while working with the company. On his show, Thursday, April 29, 2021, Adom-Otchere stated that, if Sam Jonah KBE wants to talk about the future of Ghana, then he must first of all open up about his past. “Sam Jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past...it behoves him to make statements about his past. If he won’t say anything at all, at least we know his role with Adisadel College and AshGold Football Club, we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society, the Ashanti transaction,” Paul Adom-Otchere said on his show monitored by GhanaWeb. He indicated that, there are two Ashanti transactions, one was failed by the government of Ghana, which left a lot of rancour’s between JJ Rawlings and Sam Jonah and their relationship broke off completely. “We don’t know the details. Sam Jonah must come and tell us. And then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002, this time it was supported by the JA Kufuor government and it was successful. In both transactions, there was a critical decision about the heritage of the Ghanaian young person; because this gold resource, which is a Ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way, was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today Sam Jonah is concerned about? “Was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future? Was there an option with Randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of Ghana?” he asked. Adom-Otchere stressed that, Sam Jonah KBE must answer these questions. “He [Sam Jonah] is a big man, he has been around for a very long time, and he comes and says the youth of Ghana, I now feel the responsibility to speak and you don’t tell us what you’ve been doing in the past, when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of Ghana since 1983; you won’t tell us what has happened about that…?” Paul Adom-Otchere argues that, Sam Jonah’s answer to the question will help the Ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea. “So that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time. If that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time, it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important,” he stressed.\n",

(\"Company\") and its consolidated subsidiaries (together \"Komatsu\") have engaged in the three- year mid-term management plan (FY2019 - 2021), \"DANTOTSU Value - FORWARD Together for Sustainable Growth\" for its 100th anniversary in 2021 and beyond. Under the mid-term management plan, launched in April 2019, Komatsu upholds three pillars of growth strategies of 1) value creation by means of innovation, 2) growth strategies based on business reforms, and 3) structural reforms for growth. While economic activities remain sluggish due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Komatsu will continue to make efforts for sustainable growth through a positive cycle of improving earnings and solving ESG issues into the future. For the fiscal year under review (April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021), the second year of the mid-term management plan, consolidated net sales totaled JPY 2,189.5 billion, down 10.4% from the previous fiscal year. Under unclear and uncertain conditions as affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, demand showed steady recovery, centering on construction equipment, in the second six-month period. However, sales decreased from the previous fiscal year, as full-year demand was critically affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the first six-month period. In the industrial machinery and others business, sales fell from the previous fiscal year, as affected by sluggish capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools. With respect to profits for the fiscal year under review, operating income dropped by 33.3% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 167.3 billion. This was mainly due to reduced sales volume, and changes in the compositions of sales, in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, as well as the Japanese yen's appreciation, even while Komatsu worked to reduce fixed costs. The operating income ratio decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 7.6%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies fell by 27.0% to JPY 162.7 billion. Net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd. totaled JPY 106.2 billion, down 30.9%.

Business results by operation are described below. Construction, Mining and Utility Equipment For the fiscal year under review, sales of the construction, mining and utility equipment business decreased by 10.6% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 1,975.9 billion. Segment profit fell by 36.7% to JPY 143.7 billion. Komatsu promoted efforts of focus defined in the three pillars of growth strategies in the mid-term management plan. With respect to automation, autonomy, electrification, and remote control of construction, mining, and utility equipment, i.e., an effort of focus in value creation by means of innovation, Komatsu continued to strengthen the Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) for mining, increasing the total number of AHS trucks in operation to 352 units as of March 31, 2021. Komatsu also advanced remote control verification tests of the large ICT-intensive mining bulldozer D375Ai-8 over commercial 5G network, while continuing efforts to develop an optimization platform designed to improve the safety and optimize operations at customers' mines. Concerning electrification of construction equipment, Komatsu embarked on PoC (Proof of Concept) verification tests of small and medium-sized hydraulic excavators powered by the lithium-ion battery system. With respect to the \"SMARTCONSTRUCTION Digital Transformation\", a solutions business for construction workplaces, Komatsu is appealing its role as a solution provider to help customers optimize their construction work. To accelerate the pace of achieving digital transformation of construction workplaces, Komatsu continued to promoted the installation of its retrofit kits, which offer ICT functions to conventional construction equipment. Concerning an effort of focus of the growth strategies based on business reforms, Komatsu strengthened the recycle-oriented business, establishing a new Reman plant in Southern Africa for the Reman business which remanufactures and reuses components. In the forest machinery business, Komatsu also strengthened the market introduction of machines designed to promote silviculture (growing and cultivating forest crops). As part of the structural reforms for growth, Komatsu continued its efforts to reassess Komatsu Mining Corp.'s unprofitable business and optimize their production capacity by restructuring production of underground coal mining equipment, selling its conveyor business in the United States and Australia, and transferring its production of roof supports in the United Kingdom.

Japan For the fiscal year under review, demand remained steady, centering on public works, on which the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a small impact. Nevertheless, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as adversely affected by slack private-sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six-month period. Americas In North America, sales dropped from the previous fiscal year. While demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry, it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and that for construction and mining equipment remained slack in the energy-related sector. In Latin America, demand for construction equipment remained steady in Brazil, and sales of mining equipment increased to Chilean copper mines. However, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as mainly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in the first six- month period. Europe and CIS In Europe, sales decreased from the previous fiscal year, as demand remained sluggish in the first six-month period, although demand was on a recovery track from the adverse effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the major markets of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as in Italy. In CIS, sales declined, affected by sluggish demand for mining equipment in coal mines and depreciation of the Russian ruble, while demand was steady in gold mines and that for construction equipment was on a recovery track in infrastructure development and energy-related sectors. China While the share of sales made by domestic manufacturers increased, demand remained steady, supported by the government's economic stimulus measures, such as infrastructure investment, after containing the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Furthermore, demand advanced in the fiscal year under review, driven by the post-Chinese New Year sales season in February, and because the previous year's sales season in February was pushed back by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, sales increased from the previous fiscal year. Asia and Oceania In Asia, demand showed steady recovery, centering on construction equipment, in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in Indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices. However, sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year, as particularly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the first six-month period. In Oceania, sales increased, supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron ore mines, as well as for construction equipment. Middle East and Africa In the Middle East, sales improved from the previous fiscal year, supported by steady demand, especially in Turkey, while demand remained slack in Saudi Arabia, largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In Africa, demand for construction equipment remained slack in Southern Africa, mainly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions, sales declined, as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well. Retail Finance While assets increased, reflecting an increase in new contracts centering on North America as well as the affects of foreign exchange rates in the fourth quarter, revenues decreased by 6.4% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 66.3 billion, as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine-month period. Segment profit fell by 16.6% to JPY 10.5 billion, mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use. Industrial Machinery and Others For the fiscal year under review, sales fell by 3.6% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 171.2 billion. This was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools, as well as their delayed installation at customers' overseas workplaces, especially under the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Meanwhile, segment profit increased by 19.3% to JPY 16.3 billion, as sales remained steady for Excimer laser-related business in the semiconductor market. [Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2022] (From April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022) In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review, returning to the level prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. By region, Komatsu anticipates demand will expand, especially in Asia, North America and Latin America. In China, Komatsu expects that demand will decline from the fiscal year under review, when the post-Chinese New Year sales season occurred twice. Nevertheless, Komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review. Furthermore, Komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore, copper, and gold mines, while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines. With respect to profits, Komatsu expects that they will advance, reflecting an increase in volume of sales, differences in composition of sales, and improved selling prices. In the retail finance business, Komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve, mainly due to an increase in new contracts. In the industrial machinery and others business, Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as sales of machine tools and the Excimer laser-related business should grow, respectively, in the automobile manufacturing industry and on the semiconductor market. As preconditions for its projection, Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates will be as follows: USD1=JPY 105.0, EUR1=JPY 124.0, and RMB1=JPY 16.0.

(2) Financial Conditions As of March 31, 2021, while inventories decreased from the previous fiscal year-end, total assets increased by JPY 131.1 billion to JPY 3,784.8 billion, due largely to the Japanese yen's depreciation against the U.S. dollar and some other currencies as well as increased receivables. Interest-bearing debt decreased by JPY 102.3 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to JPY 909.9 billion. Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity increased by JPY 140.6 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to JPY 1,912.2 billion. As a result, Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' ratio increased by 2.0 percentage points from the previous fiscal year-end, to 50.5%. For the fiscal year under review, net cash provided by operating activities totaled JPY 354.1 billion, an increase of JPY 58.9 billion from the previous fiscal year, largely reflecting decreased inventories. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to JPY 163.0 billion, a decrease of JPY 27.8 billion from the previous fiscal year, due mainly to the purchase of fixed assets. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to JPY 199.6 billion (as compared to JPY 3.4 billion used for the previous fiscal year), mainly due to the repayment of debt and payment of cash dividends. After adding the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations to the total amount of each cash flow, as of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled JPY 241.8 billion, a decrease of JPY 5.8 billion from the previous fiscal year-end. [Trends of Financial Conditions Indicators] (Fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019) 2021 2020 2019 Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio (%) 50.5 48.5 49.9 Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio at aggregate market 85.4 46.0 66.7 value (%) Years of debt redemption 2.6 3.4 4.6 Notes: 1) Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio: Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity/Total assets           Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio at aggregate market value: Aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock/Total assets    Years of debt redemption: Interest-bearing debt/Net cash provided by operating activities     Basic Policy for Redistribution of Profits and Dividends for the Fiscal Year under Review and Next Fiscal Year    Komatsu is building a sound financial position and enhancing its competitiveness in order to increase its sustainable corporate value. Concerning cash dividends, Komatsu has the policy of continuing stable payment of dividends after comprehensively considering consolidated business results and reviewing future investment plans, cash flows and the like. Specifically, Komatsu has the policy of maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of 40% or higher. As described earlier in this report, while demand declined in the construction, mining, and utility equipment business, as adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it has recovered sooner than expected, since the third quarter, centering on construction equipment. As a result, both sales and profits for the year outperformed the projection of consolidated business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, which Komatsu announced on October 28, 2020. Concerning cash dividends for the fiscal year under review, after considering consolidated business results for the fiscal year under review and future business prospects under its dividend policy, the Company is planning to increase the year-end common stock dividend per share by JPY 2 from the earlier projection of JPY 25 per share. At the same time, the Company plans to pay the 100th anniversary (May 13, 2021) commemorative cash dividend of JPY 10 per share. As a result, year-end cash dividends for the fiscal year under review should amount to JPY 37 per share, i.e., JPY 12 more than the latest projection of cash dividends. Annual cash dividends should total JPY 55 per share, including the interim cash dividend which has already been paid, and which is showing a decrease of JPY 39 per share from the previous fiscal year, ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, the consolidated payout ratio will translate into 48.9%. This dividend amount will be proposed to the 152nd ordinary general meeting of shareholders (scheduled for June 18, 2021). Regarding annual cash dividends for the fiscal year, ending March 31, 2022, the Company plans to pay JPY 62 per share, an increase of JPY 7 per share from the fiscal year under review.

China News Service, Putian, April 29 (Reporter Lin Chunyin) The 15th China (Putian) Strait Handicraft Fair opened on the 29th in Putian. Tens of thousands of cross-strait arts and crafts made a stunning appearance and 36 Taiwan companies participated in the exhibition. Lin Yunan, secretary-general of Taiwan&#39;s Top Craft Association, said that the cross-strait arts and crafts exchanges &quot;unstop&quot; and &quot;uninterrupted&quot;, and hope that Taiwanese arts and crafts can bloom in the mainland market. .

The &quot;cross-strait&quot; element has been the highlight of this year&#39;s art fair as always. The organizer said that due to the control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Taiwanese craftsmen could not go to Putian to participate in the exhibition, but this year, the number of Taiwanese companies participating in this year has increased to 32 compared with the previous exhibition. They are divided into Taiwan&#39;s top crafts association, Fujian and Taiwan folk crafts painted traditional lanterns, and Taiwan cultural and creative The Society won 46 booths in three exhibition halls.

The information on cross-strait cooperation trends revealed at this year&#39;s art fair has attracted much attention. The exchanges should not stop and cannot be interrupted.” Lin Yun’an also said that she is paying attention to Fujian’s first attempt to include Taiwanese craftsmen in the list of inheritors of intangible cultural heritage, and to give preference to inheritance policies. “There are more and more cultural support policies that benefit Taiwanese. It is conducive to the diversified inheritance of Chinese traditional skills and is worth looking forward to.&quot; (Editor in charge: Song Yajing)\n",

      "38. Watch the visuals of KDDO and Davido’s ‘Beamer Body’. KDDO has finally released the visuals for the Davido-assisted song Beamer Body , which is from the stable of Sony Music Entertainment West Africa and Pentlife Music. KDDO first teased the collaboration in the final quarter of last year, and it’s been highly-anticipated ever since. The release of this new banger is also sequel to the successful run of his recent and critically acclaimed Amapiano music hit,   eWallet  that shook the nation with style. Speaking on the track, KDDO remembers linking up with music heavyweight, Davido while on tour last year in Las Vegas to record  Beamer Body . “I had already started working on the single back in LA. Davido and I were playing music back at the hotel in Vegas, then the beat came on and we were all just vibing. David really liked it, he got mad hyped about it and added a verse on the spot”  says KDDO. While  Beamer Body  beat is infectious and attacked with melodies from the musical duo, its focal message (adequately represented in glimpses from the music video directed by Chris Simon) seeks to empower beautiful women from around the world to be comfortable in their bodies. “ Feel sexy, baby! There’s something about you ,” KDDO adds.   Interestingly, “ Beamer Body ” also serves as the lead single to his forth-coming debut EP project Too Late Too Lit , which is now available for  pre-order/pre-save  on music streaming platforms. The EP has been designed to be a feel-good body of work for the fans and we probably have the pandemic to thank for catalysing KDDO’s efforts to drop. KDDO will continue his genius operation from his base in Los Angeles, building upon his laurels in music some of which already include “ 1st Afrobeats RIAA Gold Award ”; “ Producer of The Year ”; “ Music Producer of the Year ”; “ Longest-charting Nigerian pop song in Billboard history  ( Fall  performed by Davido)”; “ Top 100 most Shazam-ed singles in America ”; “ 1st Nigerian producer to sell multi-platinum in South Africa ,” and also extending his collaborative reach beyond the prominence of superstars Davido, Chris Brown, AKA, Mayorkun, Cardi B, Beyonce and Popcaan.

      "68. 3 common mistakes investors make with penny stocks - The Motley Fool UK. In for a penny, in for a pound? Penny stocks can seem appealing. The idea that an investment that costs a matter of pence could generate pounds of rewards can be beguiling. But there are a lot of simple mistakes investors make choosing penny stocks. Here are three I’ve observed. Focus on price not value Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s say my children could travel to school in the cheapest bus the school can buy — or the most expensive. Which would I prefer? The answer seems obvious. For most people, quality is worth paying for. Yet penny stocks can focus our attention on price not value. The legendary investor Warren Buffett said that “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. A penny stock could indeed turn out to be good value. But to assess what the underlying value is, I’d look not just at the price. I’dd also consider the company’s future ability to generate profits and create shareholder value. Penny stocks and balance sheets One common mistake investors make is buying on share price alone without looking at the company’s balance sheet. Imagine buying a second hand car for £100. That might sound like a bargain. But if it needs to have an MOT the following week that identifies £3,000 of necessary repairs, even the £100 price tag could seem like a bad bargain in retrospect. It’s the same when a company has a lot of debt or other future financial obligations that dwarf its financial resources. How will it pay them? Will it have a rights issue and dilute shareholders as a penny stock like Hammerson did last year? Balance sheets scare many people. But they aren’t as technical as they may sound. Before investing in any penny stocks I’d always spend at least a few minutes looking at a company’s recent balance sheets. Seeing what a company’s debt profile looks like is a crucial indicator of its financial health, in my view. Single-asset focus A lot of penny stocks are exclusively or mainly focused on a single asset. I find that’s particularly true with early-stage resource stocks. For example, Bacanora Lithium is pinning a lot of hope on one project in Mexico. Sometimes, such a focus is positive and a lack of diversification can amplify rewards. If a company owns one mining licence and literally strikes gold, its return on capital could be huge. But the reverse is true as well – if a company is over-concentrated in one asset, the lack of diversification can disproportionately damage it. Single-asset focus improves potential reward only by increasing potential risk, in many cases. That matters because, as Warren Buffett reminds us: “Rule number one: never lose money. Rule number two: never forget rule number one”. That can be hard to do. But by learning from common mistakes other investors make, I hope I can improve my likely returns when identifying penny stocks to consider for my portfolio. \n",

      "104. Royal Canadian Mint Reports Profits and Performance for 2020. OTTAWA, ON, April 30, 2021 /CNW/ - The Royal Canadian Mint (the \"Mint\") is pleased to announce its financial results for 2020 that provide insight into our activities, the markets influencing our businesses and our expectations for the next 12 months. \"In 2020, employees of the Royal Canadian Mint demonstrated their ability to innovate and deliver great products in a very challenging operating environment\" said Marie Lemay, President and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint. \"Their hard work contributed to the Mint's success. Employees pivoted quickly in the face of disruption allowing the Mint to generate strong profits.\"   \"The Mint continues to respond to the unprecedented situation with COVID-19 in a proactive way that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees. We have adapted our production to be able to continue delivering critical services in support of the essential mining and financial sectors, while adhering to strict new protocols to ensure our work environment is a safe one.\" \"One very special initiative in 2020 was our Recognition Medal, created to recognize frontline workers while raising money for the Breakfast Club of Canada's COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Employees donated their time to this project and thanks to their generosity and the contrinutions of thousands of Canadians, the Mint was able to make a $400,000 donation to the Breakfast Club in 2020.\"  The financial results should be read in conjunction with the Mint's annual report available at www.mint.ca. All monetary amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Financial and Operational Highlights The Mint increased its revenue by 74% in 2020 as a result of exceptionally strong global market demand for bullion while consolidated profit before income tax and other items was $27.5 million for the year (2019 – $42.3 million). Higher bullion volumes sold in 2020 increased the Mint's revenue and cost of sales proportionately; however, the Mint's profit margin was impacted in 2020 by lower revenue from its other businesses, without a corresponding decrease in costs. In particular, the Mint continued to pay its employees and did not reduce any fixed costs during the periods of suspended or modified production as a result of the pandemic impacting the Mint's profit margin in 2020 by approximately $6 million. Consolidated revenue increased to $2,527.6 million in 2020 (2019 - $1,453.4 million). Gold bullion volumes increased more than 100% year over year and were 982.8 thousand ounces (2019 – 483.0 thousand ounces) while silver bullion volumes were 29.5 million ounces (2019 – 22.8 million ounces). Sales of numismatic products decreased to $91.9 million in 2020 (2019 - $116.8 million) due mainly to the temporary suspension of numismatic product production as a result of COVID-19 in 2020. Revenue from the Foreign Circulation business decreased 2% to $64.2 million (2019 - $65.4 million) with production and/or shipments of 838 million coins in 2020 and blanks compared to 1,308 million coins and blanks in 2019. Canadian circulation coins produced and sold to the Department of Finance for inventory were 229 million pieces in 2020 (2019 – 385 million pieces) while coins sold to financial institutions to meet demand decreased 8% year over year. Operating expenses, overall, increased 4% year over year to $98.5 million (2019 – $94.5 million) as the Mint focused on enhanced organizational resiliency in 2020 and the development of its updated long-term strategic vision and the strategy for the Mint's future business transformation.   Cash and cash equivalents increased to $67.3 million (December 31, 2019 - $65.5 million) after the Mint declared and paid a $20 million dividend to its Shareholder, the Government of Canada, in 2020. Cash and cash equivalents remain at the level required to support the Mint's operations.   Consolidated results and financial performance(in CAD $ millions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019)  Year ended December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 $ Change % Change Revenue $ 2,527.6 $ 1,453.4 $ 1,074.2 74 Profit before income tax and other items1 $ 27.5 $ 42.3 $ (14.8) (35) Profit before income tax and other items margin 1.1% 2.9% Profit for the period $ 37.7 $ 34.8 (1)   A reconciliation from profit for the period to profit before income tax and other items is included on page 35 of the Mint's 2020 annual report.   As at December 31, 2020 December 31,  2019 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 67.3 $ 65.5 $ 1.8 3 Inventories $ 57.6 $ 94.9 $ (37.3) (39) Capital assets $ 161.1 $ 173.9 $ (12.8) (7) Total assets $ 379.4 $ 429.9 $ (50.5) (12) Working capital $ 112.9 $ 102.5 $ 10.4 10 As part of its business continuity plan, the Mint continues to actively monitor its global supply chain and logistics networks in support of its continued operations.

      "110. Hammersmith Bridge: Bridge of sighs and a shameful collective catalogue of failure. Clemmie Watkins used to have a 10-minute walk to school across . Since September, it has become a 40-minute bike ride via  on roads plagued by speeding drivers and riverside paths that flood when the Thames rises. On winter nights, even adults avoid her unlit route home across Dukes Meadows, a haunt of muggers and doggers. On Wednesday the 13-year-old slipped and fell crossing a wet Barnes bridge, cutting herself and ruining her school skirt. “It’s really annoying,” she said. “If it floods it’s so much longer in the rain. It’s not good.” by Hammersmith and Fulham council when cracks were detected in its pedestals. The crossing was kept open to pedestrians and cyclists until August last year, but the cracks widened. Since then, the effect on  has been “catastrophic”, . About 4,000 vehicles a day divert via her Putney constituency. Even at 7am, the already polluted approaches to Putney bridge, the nearest alternative crossing, are gridlocked. The inability to reopen the bridge has made London a laughing stock. Politicians blame each other while residents despair. Ms Anderson describes it as an “international embarrassment”. It has even made the New York Times. On September 9 last year, Transport Secretary , accompanied by Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey, visited the bridge. In a video, Mr Shapps vowed to “take control” and “get it fixed and reopened”. . Yesterday it met for the 15th time. The taskforce includes representatives from Transport for London and Heidi Alexander, Sadiq Khan’s deputy mayor for transport. But Mr Khan said this week that the taskforce had been little more than a “talking shop to kick the can down the road”. Clemmie’s mother, Julia Watkins, a member of the Hammersmith Bridge SOS residents’ group, agrees. “You can’t walk over a taskforce,” she said. “They have done nothing. They were meant to be knocking heads together. Baroness Vere points the finger at Hammersmith and Fulham council. The council points the finger at Grant Shapps.” A resident survey found some feeling suicidal because of the closure. Almost nine in 10 said they had suffered worse mental health. The apolitical Hammersmith Society, in a letter to the Prime Minister, said: “The communities on both sides of the river are unified in their anger, their disappointment and their despair.” There is a growing acknowledgement that only the Government has the financial might to break the deadlock. The council owns the bridge but cannot afford the £141 million restoration bill. Mr Shapps wants the council to pay half the bill.  has provided about £20 million for investigations and design work, including £4 million for a temporary ferry and repairs from a government Covid bail-out last year. “The Government should be able to break this deadlock,” Ms Watkins said. “They could have straightaway funded a temporary pedestrian and cycling bridge. Instead they went for this ludicrous ferry. It’s completely inadequate.” Even the ferry has been delayed. An initial plan was to have it start operating last autumn. Uber Boat by Thames Clippers has won the contract but two temporary piers have yet to be constructed. Residents fear services may not start until November. “Our contract is to have it running by the beginning of October, but we are in negotiations with TfL to accelerate that,” said a spokesman for Beckett Rankine, which will design the piers. “TfL would like it ready at the start of September, but there are a lot of things that have to go right. Normally it would take a year to build a new pier.” The contract between TfL and Thames Clippers is for a minimum of 12 months, to a maximum of five years. Adults will be charged £1.55 per crossing, though children will travel free. There will be two ferries, with a third as back-up. The crossing will take 90 seconds, with a boat every five to seven minutes in peak hours. “It will be a huge improvement for the residents,” the Beckett Rankine spokesman said. “It will be a very slick service. Thames Clippers know what they are doing.” The source added: “It’s a lot cheaper than a temporary bridge.” The council’s preferred option is a “double decker” bridge. Designed by architects Foster + Partners and specialist bridge engineers COWI, it would cost about £100 million — £41 million less than fully restoring the existing bridge. This could allow the bridge to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists in summer next year, and to drivers two months later — four years earlier than otherwise planned. But motorists would face an estimated £3 toll. The other hope for a “quick win” rests with engineers who have analysed the structural integrity of the pedestals. It may be the case that the ironwork has stabilised and the bridge could be safe to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists. The engineers’ report was submitted to the DfT three weeks ago. But sources say that “further engineering analysis and checks need to be completed” — and this could take a further three months. Behind the scenes there is concern about safety. The Government wants the council to retain liability should anything go wrong. Residents are furious at the thought that a “risk-averse culture” could be used as an excuse to keep the bridge closed. “On that basis, politicians should close every bridge in the country,” one said, noting that teenagers continue to climb the railings to cross the bridge at night and use it as a skateboard park. “If they continue to do that after the engineers’ report shows it’s safe, that is just despicable. They’re ruining people’s lives.” The key date is when the clocks go back in October, when the thousands a day who follow Clemmie’s route risk being stranded on the wrong side of the river. Michelle Coulter, another member of Hammersmith Bridge SOS, whose daughters Iris, 16, and Lana, 13, also attend school in Hammersmith, said children were often unable to board the replacement buses. Under Covid rules, the single-deckers can only carry 14 passengers. “Since August it’s become so stressful, I cannot tell you,” she said. “My youngest finishes school at 4pm. In winter she was getting home at 5.30pm, sometimes 6pm. That was by bus.” Mr Khan accuses the Government of “dither and delay” and failing to honour promises made before the 2019 General Election. The council submitted its double-decker bridge proposal in February, but it is regarded by the DfT to be lacking detail. Two weeks ago, minister Rachel Maclean accused the council of wearing “gold-tinted lenses” and said a “blank cheque” would not be forthcoming. The DfT said it could not comment due to pre-election purdah restrictions. Sadiq Khan (Lab) Keen to have the bridge reopened to pedestrians and cyclists if engineers find the structure safe but says the bridge will only fully reopen to vehicles when the Government covers the bulk of the cost. A TfL-funded ferry service is due to start in the autumn. Shaun Bailey (Con) Promises to make the ferry free, build a temporary road bridge and fully repair the existing bridge, which he would rename the Prince Philip bridge. Says it is essential the bridge can carry vehicles and would not impose a toll on motorists. Says TfL should have funded the full repairs as soon as the bridge closed in 2019. He would fund his ideas by establishing a TfL investment fund. Sian Berry (Green) Believes the Department for Transport should provide “at least the majority of the costs” of repairing the bridge, and wants a date to be set for the reopening of the bridge for walking and cycling. Luisa Porritt (Lib Dem) “The Government is the only body with the funds to foot the bill. The mayor could make a bigger contribution if the £2 billion Silvertown Tunnel road project was axed.”\n",

      "116. Lucea Primary School fighting back challenges caused. THE Lucea Primary School, which provided educational instruction to thousands of students from across Hanover and adjacent parishes, is fighting back the the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  Principal of the 62-year-old institution, Yazmin Anderson Jackson, says the students and staff have embraced the changes that have transformed the modalities of lessons that are delivered and how stakeholders interact with each other. Students preparing for the Grade Six Primary Exit Profile (PEP) Ability Test were given an opportunity to have face-to-face classes between February 1, 2021 and March 18, 2021. However, the spike in COVID-19 cases in the parish has forced classes to return online. Grade six social studies teacher Francena Black is highly motivated and hopes to pass on her enthusiasm to her students. Black, who is faced with the daily challenges of keeping her students motivated, said being online requires new approaches to lesson delivery. She has incorporated different modalities to maintain her students' interest. One such method is through the use of different resource persons to teach subjects in their areas of expertise. “We find that it really gets them engaged. Having [different resource persons] throughout the day, we find that this makes a great difference,” Black said, citing “guest teachers” from the Forestry Department, the Hanover Municipal Corporation and the Jamaica Information Service . The school, which had its genesis in an old soldier barracks near the seaside, is currently located in Malcolm Heights, which overlooks the aquamarine waters of Lucea Harbour. At present, there are more than 625 students on roll and 31 teachers on staff. Lucea Primary is propelled by the vision of excellence for all. In light of this, programmes are implemented to help students become well rounded. The motto, 'Soaring High on Integrity', alludes to that. Anderson Jackson is proud to note that students have earned scholarships due to their high academic performance. “Over the years, we have excellent performances at the JCDC festival, winning many gold medals as well as silver medals in dance, music and speech,” she said. “Students are also involved in sports and have been crowned parish champions in cricket and football,” Anderson Jackson notes, pointing out that the school has showcased its talents in Spanish and 4-H competitions and continues to provide these avenues for self-expression and development for its students. She said that COVID-19 has forced the school to use the Google Suite platform, and “we have been coping quite well” Despite the challenges of poor Internet connectivity in some areas, loss of electricity occasionally and the lack of devices for some students, Anderson Jackson is optimistic that her school community will continue to rise. “Our highly trained staff goes beyond the call of duty to ensure that students are catered for at all levels and that the school lives up to its mission to provide a system which secures quality holistic education for all students,” she told JIS News.

Picture: BloombergDAMON KITNEYVICTORIAN BUSINESS EDITOR6:42PM APRIL 25, 2021Melbourne investment banker Bruce Parncutt calls his latest plaything a “gold discovery company”.Neither an explorer nor a miner, the ASX-listed DGO Gold — of which Mr Parncutt has been an executive director for the past year — is looking to carve out a unique niche in the Australian gold sector.Its game plan is to make strategic equity investments in West Australian brownfield gold discoveries, bankroll themwith additional capital and combine them with its own pursuit of largely-ignored exploration opportunities.Mr Parncutt said he hopes DGO has created a model that can reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia.“Gold is our fourth largest export so the industry is pretty important for the nation. We do the mining part well but I’m not so sure we do the exploration part well. Especially the brownfields guys who need to get their resource to some scale,” he said. “Most junior explorers find a piece of ground and they raise the capital and explore. We think we are adding intelligent value to that process.” DGO is also a unique human story, combining the skills of a career investment banker and former boss of McIntosh Securities in Mr Parncutt, with the exploration expertise of one of the resource sector’s most famed geologists, Ed Eshuys.As Joseph Gutnick’s exploration director in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr Eshuys led the teams that discovered the Plutonic, Bronzewing and Jundee gold deposits and the Cawse nickel deposit. Before those triumphs, Mr Eshuys also had involvement in the Maggie Hays and Mariners nickel discoveries in the 1970s.He is now DGO Gold’s executive chairman and is working closely with Mr Parncutt — who has been on the board since 2018 — and DGO’s management team to develop two sizeable WA gold resources and to explore for more.“We do bring together a unique set of skills. It is all very well to have the money but to apply that you need the technical skills” Mr Eshuys said.“Bruce and I do debate between ourselves our respective points of view and invariably come up with a consensus. That has led us to a disciplined approach to take DGO from where it was to where it is now.”DGO Gold directors Ed Eshuys and Bruce Parncutt.DGO Gold initially evaluated 100 gold explorers and their projects. Ten ASX juniors made the shortlist before DGO narrowed it down to two, taking strategic stakes in booming Pilbara gold explorer De Grey Mining and Leonora gold explorer NTM Gold.DGO has a string of major greenfield exploration projects of its own being drilled, including on prime South Australian ground owned by junior explorer Investigator Resources as the first stage to earning an 80 per cent stake in the latter’s Pernatty copper project. DGO also has a 40 per cent interest in Yilgarn Exploration Ventures, which is drilling in the Leonora district of Western Australia.“One of the critical things we found when we were talking to all the juniors was that they didn’t understand the need to have at least 3 million ounces to have something of meaningful scale,” Mr Eshuys said.“Part of our discussions with these companies was about raising sufficient funds to do the job properly. That is where De Grey came to the party. They did understand they needed to raise more money and they did that.”The strategy has seen DGO Gold shares soar from just 17c four years ago, and $1.70 last year when Mr Parncutt became an executive, to close on Friday at $3.63.They soared over $4 in September last year on the back of the coronavirus-fuelled surge in the gold price, which saw it spike to $US2056 per ounce last August.While gold prices have trended lower since the start of 2021 amid rising US Treasury yields and an increasingly positive outlook for the global economic recovery, the DGO share price has held up.DGO now owns 16 per cent of De Grey, which is drilling out a significant Pilbara gold discovery. It also has board representation and has supported De Grey’s capital raisings, including a $25m round last September.“De Grey is in a unique position in terms of its Pilbara land position. That is one of our key elements when we invest and explore,” Mr Eshuys said.Following the merger late last year of NTM Gold with Dacian Gold, DGO will now emerge with a 10 per cent stake in Dacian.Of the $25m raised last September, $8m was also pegged for greenfield exploration.The value of DGO’s stake in De Grey covers its $225m market capitalisation, meaning the market is currently attributing no value to DGO’s substantial exploration interests.DGO has attracted some big name investors, including stockbroking veteran Tom Klinger, one of Christopher Skase’s biggest backers through the 1980s and another former McIntosh managing director. Others are former stockbroking resources turned private equity fund adviser Peter Woodford, the rich-lister Costa family member Robert Costa and Regal Funds Management.\n",

      "135. Global gold demand, first quarter near low level for the first time in 13 years Investor sales. [London, 29th Reuters] --Global gold demand in the first quarter of this year has remained near its lowest level since 2008, according to a quarterly report released by the World Gold Council (WGC), an international gold research institute. It was. While Asian consumer buying has returned, investor sales have expanded in Europe and North America. Last year, as the spread of the new coronavirus hit the global economy, investors were increasingly buying gold as a safe haven. At the same time, lockdowns to curb the spread of infection have slowed sales of gold jewelery, gold nuggets and gold coins in China and India, which are normally the two biggest consumers. As the global economy recovers, this trend is now reversing, with investors shrinking their holdings and Asian consumer buying returning. According to the WGC, global gold demand from January to March this year was 815.7 tons, a slight increase from 813.7 tons in the previous quarter. However, it decreased by 23% year-on-year. Consumer demand in China was 286.4 tonnes, the highest level since the first quarter of 2017. On the other hand, exchange-traded fund (ETF) gold holdings fell by 177.9 tons, the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2013. Due to the sale by ETF, the gold price fell from the record high of 1 ounce = $ 2072.50 in August last year to around $ 1,700 in March. According to the WGC, this helped boost demand for Asians. In April, ETF sales slowed sharply and gold prices picked up towards $ 1800. WGC analyst Christian Gopaul said consumers and investors&#39; demand for gold this year is likely to remain resilient, albeit below its recent peak. Gold purchased by the central bank in the first quarter was 95.5 tonnes, the highest level since the second quarter of last year. However, it was well below the typical level seen in 2018 and 2019.

Canada Nickel (CNC) owns 100% of the Crawford Nickel-Cobalt Sulphide project: A new nickel discovery with large scale potential in an established mining camp adjacent to existing infrastructure north of Timmins, Ontario, Canada.    One of the top 10 nickel sulphide resources globally, with significant expansion potential    Initial metallurgical testing confirmed excellent nickel recovery of 46%, 51% and 52% from the first 3 locked cycle tests using conventional flowsheet design. Latest testing show 15% less grinding energy required    Nickel mineralization in Crawford extended to Main, East, West and North Zones, with total strike length of ~7 km. New target from MacDiarmid option property 15% larger than original Crawford Main Zone    Groundbreaking, mutually beneficial MOUs signed with local First Nations    Canada Nickel has launched wholly-owned NetZero Metals Inc. to develop zero-carbon production of Nickel, Cobalt and Iron - has applied for trademarks NetZero Nickel TM , NetZero Cobalt TM , NetZero Iron TM    Canada Nickel is completing a PEA on the Crawford Project by May 2021, FS by year-end 2021    MOU signed with Glencore to examine potential to use Kidd Creek mill and met site to allow faster, significantly lower capital cost startup.    Canada Nickel is well timed - nickel appears to be entering a supercycle which occur every 15-20 years.    Prices should remain at relatively high levels for an extended period to incent new supply to meet already strong demand growth further accelerated by substantial requirements from electric vehicles    Nickel has limited investible opportunities - Prior supercycle in 2005-2007 largely emptied project pipeline outside Indonesia. * Mineral Resource Estimate prepared by Caracle 3 Creek International Consulting Inc.

Palladium pierced the $3,000 an ounce high for the first time on Friday, powered by persistent concerns about short supply of the metal used primarily for emissions-controlling devices in automobiles. Palladium was last up 1% to $2,984.68 per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $3,007.73. It was on track to post a monthly gain as well. \"Palladium is in a structural deficit since 10 years. We have seen above ground inventories falling to very low levels, and now the price gives a signal to investors still holding it,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. \"The commodity ... comes with very low trading volume so it can be very illiquid and this is making the moves even more crazy. This rally can continue, particularly if car sales start to improve going forward.\" Demand from the auto industry is rising and expected to climb further as a semiconductor chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production eases later this year. But Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said prices are unlikely to see a sustained run above $3,000, with substitution likely to bring prices down as the year goes on. \"At this level more and more car manufacturers will think about substitution (of palladium for platinum).\" A shift to electric vehicles may also eventually erode palladium demand, although tightening environmental rules have forced carmakers to use more and more palladium in their gasoline engines in recent years. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,769.00. Data showed on Thursday that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter. Separately, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed a dip in initial claims for state unemployment benefits. Silver fell 0.5% to $25.96 per ounce, though was poised for an over 6% monthly gain - its biggest since last December. Platinum was up 0.7% at $1,206.   (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Peter Hobson in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)    Dear Reader,  Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

      "158. China&#39;s gold production in the first quarter shrinks by 10% and consumption is 94%. The China Gold Association announced that the domestic raw material gold production in the first quarter of this year was 74.44 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 9.92%. Among them, China National Gold, Shandong Gold, Zijin Mining, Shandong Zhaojin and other large gold conglomerates produced 30.78 tons of mineral gold, accounting for the proportion of the country. Up to 52.25%. According to the association, the actual consumption of gold in the country during the period was 288.2 tons, an increase of 93.9% year-on-year. Among them, gold jewellery was 169.18 tons, an increase of 83.81%. Based on the low base caused by the outbreak in the same period last year, and the results of China&#39;s overall epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development gradually appearing, the gold consumption in the first quarter has returned to the level of the same period in 2019. The scale of domestic gold ETFs continued to grow in the first quarter, with a total increase of 11.5 tons. As of the end of March, domestic gold ETF holdings were about 72.4 tons. The association stated that high-quality resources and high-quality productivity are further concentrated in large gold companies. The fall in gold prices has also prompted an increase in demand from industrial gold companies. The improvement in the macro economy and the fall in gold prices have caused physical gold investment to continue the high heat in the fourth quarter of last year, with a sharp rise year-on-year. In the first quarter of 2021, with the turnaround of the global epidemic and the steady progress of vaccination, as well as the continuous strengthening of the U.S. dollar under the large-scale fiscal stimulus of the Biden government of the United States, the price of gold fluctuated and corrected during the period.\n",

      "168. National karate fighters win medals at Unmei Cup-2021. By Laman Ismayilova Azerbaijani karate fighters have won two medals at Unmei Cup-2021 in Belarus.  The karate fighters of the Azerbaijan Emergencies Ministry's Sports and Recreation Center enriched the country's medal haul with gold and silver medals.  More than 450 karate fighters from seven countries took part in the international karate tournament.  Nijat Karimli (61 kg) took gold in kumite and silver in the individual championship. Nihad Karimzade (70 kg) also became a silver medalist. Their first coaches were honored coaches, 6th degree black belt holders Akif Kerimov and Rafael Mammadov. Now young karate fighters are trained by the two-time world champion in karate, holder of 8th degree black belt, first vice-president of the Azerbaijan Taekwondo Federation, director of the Sports and Health Center under the Azerbaijan Ministry of Emergencies, Colonel Fizuli Musayev. The coach has recently met with karate fighters and wished them further success. Notably, the national karate fighters will take part in Karate 1 Youth League to be held in Cyprus this June. Azerbaijani karate team is considered one of the strongest teams in Europe and the World. The National Karate Federation was founded in 1994. Three years later, it became a full member of the World Karate Federation (WKF). WKF is the only karate federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee, whose main objective is to combine the basic style of karate under the general rules of the competition and enter into the program of the Olympic Games. It is the largest and most powerful karate organization in the world, comprising 183 countries and more than 50 million members. Over the past few years, national karate fighters have won prestigious international tournaments, European and World championships. Rafael Aghayev has managed to achieve all of the highest sporting victories in karate; he is multiple European Champion and multiple World Champion. For outstanding sports achievements, he has repeatedly received awards from the leadership of the National Olympic Committee, the Youth and Sport Ministry of Azerbaijan Republic. The President of the World Karate Federation, Antonio Espinosa, called him \"Diamond of the Karate World.\" Rafael Aghayev won a gold medal in karate (kumite) competitions at the 4th Islamic Solidarity Games in Baku. He secured the gold medal thanks to a victory over Pakistani Ghulam Abbas in the 75kg division final. Irina Zaretska is also known for her numerous victories at the international area. She is the owner of the gold medal at the Premier League Karate1 2014 in Almere, bronze at \"World Karate Cup 2014\", gold at the Premier League Karate1 2015 in Istanbul, silver at the Premier League Karate1 2017, etc. Azerbaijani karate fighters showed their best at the 29th European Championship among cadets and juniors. Rafael Aghayev (60 kg) and Jeyhun Aghasiyev (65 kg) won gold medals among cadets for the first time. Rashad Huseynov (65 kg) grabbed bronze among juniors. --- Follow us on Twitter  @AzerNewsAz          \n",

IRW-PRESS: OceanaGold Corp. : OceanaGold meldet Finanzergebnisse für das erste Quartal 2021 (Alle Finanzzahlen in US-Dollar, sofern nicht anders angegeben) (BRISBANE) OceanaGold Corporation (TSX: OGC) (ASX: OGC) (das \"Unternehmen\" - https://www.commodity-tv.com/ondemand/companies/profil/oceanagold-corp/) meldete seine Finanz- und Betriebsergebnisse für das Quartal zum 31. März 2021. Details des Konzernabschlusses und der Management Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") sind auf der Website des Unternehmens unter www.oceanagold.com verfügbar. Highlights - Konsolidierte Goldproduktion im ersten Quartal von 83.191 Unzen zu konsolidierten All-In Sustaining Costs (\"AISC\") von 1.229 $ pro Unze bei einem Verkauf von 82.847 Unzen Gold. - Sofort verfügbare Gesamtliquidität in Höhe von 195,5 Mio. US-Dollar, einschließlich 145,5 Mio. US-Dollar an Barmitteln und 50 Mio. US-Dollar an nicht in Anspruch genommenen Kreditlinien. - Umsatz im ersten Quartal von 148,9 Mio. US-Dollar mit einem bereinigten Gewinn vor Zinsen, Abschreibungen und Amortisationen (\"EBITDA\") von 66,5 Mio. US-Dollar; bereinigter Nettogewinn von 21,8 Mio. US-Dollar oder 0,03 US-Dollar pro Aktie. - Operativer Cashflow von 47,6 Mio. US-Dollar im ersten Quartal mit einem voll verwässerten Cashflow pro Aktie vor Betriebskapitalbewegungen von 0,09 US-Dollar pro Aktie. - Bekanntgabe einer Erhöhung der nachgewiesenen und wahrscheinlichen Goldreserven auf 0,75 Mio. Unzen und der gemessenen und angezeigten Ressourcen auf 0,66 Mio. Unzen; erste Reserven von 0,62 Mio. Unzen bei Martha Underground gemeldet. - Die organischen Wachstumsprojekte wurden vorangetrieben, einschließlich der Erschließung von 2.311 Metern bei Waihi's Martha Underground und der Fortschritte bei den Hauptzugangs- und Belüftungsstollen für Golden Point Underground bei Macraes. - Prognose für das Gesamtjahr 2021 bekräftigt. Michael Holmes, President und CEO von OceanaGold, sagte: \"Die Ergebnisse des ersten Quartals 2021 zeigen unsere Entschlossenheit, unsere Verpflichtungen zu erfüllen. Trotz der einmaligen Herausforderungen beim Mühlenbetrieb bei Haile und Macraes hat der Einfallsreichtum unserer Teams dafür gesorgt, dass wir die Erwartungen für das erste Quartal erfüllt haben, und wir sind weiterhin auf dem besten Weg, die Prognose für das Gesamtjahr 2021 zu erreichen. In Haile hat der Betrieb im ersten Quartal eine Rekordzahl an Abbaubewegungen erzielt und Störungen im Mahlbetrieb schnell identifiziert, bewertet und behoben. Bei Macraes produzierte der Betrieb trotz des Ausfalls eines unserer Mühlenmotoren, der den Durchsatz verlangsamte, im Quartal knapp 35.000 Unzen Gold, und die Prognose für das Gesamtjahr bleibt unverändert.\" \"Wir treiben unsere organische Wachstumspipeline mit drei neuen Untertageminen in den nächsten zwei Jahren in günstigen Jurisdiktionen weiter voran. In Neuseeland ist Martha Underground auf dem besten Weg, Ende des zweiten Quartals mit der kontinuierlichen Produktion zu beginnen und untermauert den größeren Waihi-Distrikt. Wir planen, bei Waihi noch jahrelang zu bohren und die bereits robuste Lebensdauer der Mine zu verlängern. Bei Macraes sind der Hauptzugang und die Belüftungsschächte für den Untertagebau Golden Point im Gange und das Projekt ist auf dem Weg zur ersten Produktion bis zum Jahresende. Bei Haile Underground werden die Vorbereitungen in Erwartung der Portalentwicklung im Laufe dieses Jahres fortgesetzt. \"Wir sind weiterhin im Dialog mit den zuständigen Vertretern auf nationaler und lokaler Ebene über den Status der FTAA-Erneuerung von Didipio. Derzeit liegt die Erneuerung beim Ministerium für Umwelt und natürliche Ressourcen zur erneuten Bestätigung durch das Büro des Präsidenten. In der Zwischenzeit halten wir Didipio in einem Zustand der Betriebsbereitschaft und planen den Übergang zur vollen Produktion. Das COVID-19-Risiko ist auf den Philippinen und am Standort, wo im letzten Jahr neun Mitglieder unserer Belegschaft positiv auf das Virus getestet wurden, weiterhin erhöht. Anhaltende Risiken im Zusammenhang mit der Pandemie könnten den Zeitplan für die Rückkehr zum vollen Betrieb beeinflussen.\" \"OceanaGold ist ein widerstandsfähiges und dynamisches Goldbergbauunternehmen mit einer starken und nachhaltigen Zukunft. Wir freuen uns auf die nächsten Jahre und die Gelegenheit, die wir haben, um durch internes Wachstum Werte zu schaffen. Unser unnachgiebiger Fokus auf die Erfüllung unserer Verpflichtungen, den Neustart von Didipio und das Vorantreiben des organischen Wachstums wird voraussichtlich langfristig Wert für die Aktionäre schaffen.

Cashflow aus / (verwendet)  (6.7)  117.2         44.8 für Finanzierungstätigkeit Betrieb Im Quartal, das am 31. März 2021 endete, produzierte das Unternehmen 83.191 Unzen Gold, was einen Anstieg von 3 % gegenüber dem vorangegangenen März-Quartal und einen Rückgang von 16 % gegenüber dem Vorquartal darstellt. Der Anstieg der Produktion im Vergleich zum ersten Quartal 2020 spiegelt die stärkere Leistung von Haile wider, die teilweise durch die geringere Produktion der neuseeländischen Betriebe ausgeglichen wurde. Die geringere Produktion im Quartalsvergleich ist in erster Linie auf Neuseeland zurückzuführen, wo eine Mühlenstörung Macraes beeinträchtigte und Waihi wie geplant eine reduzierte Verarbeitungskampagne durchführte. Haile war ebenfalls rückläufig, wobei ein höherer durchschnittlicher Einsatzgrad durch einen geringeren Mühlendurchsatz ausgeglichen wurde. Didipio blieb in einem Zustand der Betriebsbereitschaft. Die steigenden konsolidierten Cash-Kosten in Höhe von 800 $ pro Unze und die All-in Sustaining Costs (\"AISC\") in Höhe von 1.229 $ pro verkaufter Unze spiegeln die geringere Produktion und die im Vergleich zum Vorquartal höheren kapitalisierten Vorabstriche wider, insbesondere bei Macraes. Das Unternehmen verzeichnete im ersten Quartal einen Goldabsatz von 82.847 Unzen, was einem Rückgang von 14 % gegenüber dem vierten Quartal 2020 entspricht. In Haile produzierte der Betrieb im ersten Quartal 44.341 Unzen Gold, 51 % mehr als im vorangegangenen März-Quartal, was auf eine verbesserte Produktivität beim Abbau zurückzuführen ist. Die Goldproduktion und der Mühlendurchsatz waren im ersten Quartal um 10 % bzw. 20 % niedriger als im Vorquartal, was auf Probleme mit dem Fluss des gesättigten saprolitischen Erzes zur Anlage (die im Laufe des Quartals angegangen und behoben wurden) und einen geplanten dreitägigen Anlagenstillstand zurückzuführen ist. Gleichzeitig stiegen die gesamten Bergbaubewegungen um 24 % bzw. 7 % gegenüber dem vorangegangenen März-Quartal bzw. dem vierten Quartal 2020, und der Betrieb erreichte im Quartal einen Rekord an Gesamtbewegungen. Der Anstieg der Kosten für den Abbau und das Mahlen bei Haile im ersten Quartal spiegelt den geringeren Anlagendurchsatz, die Auswirkungen von einmaligen Kosten im Zusammenhang mit der Abschwächung von Anlagenstörungen durch gesättigtes Erz und in geringerem Maße den zusätzlichen Personalbestand zur Bewältigung der COVID-19-bedingten Abwesenheit der Belegschaft wider. Die bestätigten COVID-19-Fälle am Standort stiegen von 63 am Ende des Jahres 2020 auf 111 im ersten Quartal. Das Unternehmen geht weiterhin davon aus, dass Haile 150.000 bis 170.0000 Unzen Gold bei AISC des Standorts von 950 bis 1.100 $ pro verkaufter Unze produzieren wird, und weist darauf hin, dass der Ausblick durch zusätzliche Herausforderungen im Zusammenhang mit der COVID-19-Pandemie beeinträchtigt werden könnte. In Neuseeland produzierte Waihi im ersten Quartal 4.337 Unzen Gold. Die Aktivitäten bei Waihi konzentrierten sich in erster Linie auf die Erschließung von Martha Underground, einschließlich der Fertigstellung von 2.311 Metern Untertageerschließung im ersten Quartal. Darüber hinaus meldete das Unternehmen in Verbindung mit der abgeschlossenen Machbarkeitsstudie die erste Reserve von 620.000 Unzen Gold bei Martha Underground (\"MUG\"). Die Erschließung von MUG verläuft nach Plan, sodass die kontinuierliche Produktion im Juni nach dem Austausch der bestehenden SAG-Mühle von Waihi beginnen wird. Die Prognose für das Gesamtjahr 2021 bei Waihi bleibt unverändert. Die Produktion von Macraes ging im Quartalsvergleich um 19 % und im Vergleich zum vorangegangenen Quartal im März um 12 % zurück, was in erster Linie auf eine einmalige Unterbrechung des Mühlenbetriebs aufgrund eines Ausfalls des Mühlenmotors Anfang Februar zurückzuführen ist. Darüber hinaus erforderten außergewöhnlich starke Regenfälle im Januar eine zweiwöchige Evakuierung von Frasers Underground und verhinderten vorübergehend den Zugang zum Erzabbau in den Tagebauen; daher wurden die Abbauanstrengungen auf einen verstärkten Abbau von Abraum und Vorabbau im Tagebau Deepdell North gerichtet. Die höheren AISC im ersten Quartal spiegeln den geringeren Mühlendurchsatz und die erhöhten Investitionen in den Unterhalt und die Vorabbauaktivitäten wider. Die Gesamtjahresprognose für Macraes bleibt unverändert. Das Unternehmen geht davon aus, dass der Mühlenmotor im zweiten Quartal ersetzt wird, während gleichzeitig der Autoklav planmäßig neu gemauert wird. Didipio befindet sich weiterhin im Zustand der Betriebsbereitschaft. Im ersten Quartal gab es keine Produktion, da der Betrieb aufgrund der anhaltenden Blockade der Zufahrtsstraße eingestellt wurde. Das Unternehmen verbuchte 4,5 Mio. $ an Holdingkosten als Teil der konsolidierten Corporate General and Administration, die sich auf die Aufrechterhaltung von Didipio im Zustand der Betriebsbereitschaft beziehen. Dies steht im Vergleich zu $9,1 Mio. im vorherigen Quartal. Das Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement (\"FTAA\") muss derzeit noch vom philippinischen Department of Environment and Natural Resources (\"DENR\") an das Office of the President rückbestätigt werden. Das Unternehmen ist nicht in der Lage, einen konkreten Zeitplan für den Abschluss der Erneuerung zu nennen. Die Ausbreitung und das effektive Management von COVID-19 auf den Philippinen kann ein Faktor für den Zeitplan für die Wiederaufnahme des normalen Betriebs sein, der bis zu 12 Monate dauern könnte. Seit März 2020 wurden in Didipio neun positive COVID-19-Fälle verwaltet, von denen vier im ersten Quartal 2021 auftraten. Finanzen In den drei Monaten, die am 31. März 2021 endeten, erwirtschaftete das Unternehmen einen Umsatz von 148,9 Mio. $ und ein bereinigtes EBITDA von 66,5 Mio. $, was 11 % bzw. 6 % unter dem des Vorquartals liegt, was auf geringere Goldverkäufe aus Neuseeland zurückzuführen ist. Im ersten Quartal stiegen der Umsatz und das bereinigte EBITDA um 8 % bzw. 34 % gegenüber dem vorangegangenen März-Quartal, was auf eine verbesserte Leistung von Haile und einen um 18 % höheren durchschnittlichen Goldpreis in diesem Zeitraum zurückzuführen ist. Der bereinigte Nettogewinn (ohne Didipio-Buchhaltungskosten) betrug im ersten Quartal 21,8 Mio. $ oder 0,03$ pro Aktie und profitierte von der Verbesserung des durchschnittlichen Goldpreises gegenüber dem Vorjahresquartal. Der operative Cashflow lag im ersten Quartal bei 47,6 Mio. $, ein Anstieg im Vergleich zum Vorquartal, der auf den stärkeren Goldpreis und niedrigere Buchhaltungskosten für Didipio zurückzuführen ist. Dies wurde teilweise durch Bewegungen des Betriebskapitals aufgrund einer Erhöhung der Lagerbestände bei Haile ausgeglichen. Der voll verwässerte Cashflow pro Aktie vor Working-Capital-Bewegungen betrug $0,09 pro Aktie. Der Investitions-Cashflow in Höhe von 71,9 Mio. $ im ersten Quartal erhöhte sich im Vergleich zum Vorquartal aufgrund höherer Investitionsausgaben bei Haile für die Erweiterung des Abfalllagers und der Vorabstreifungsaktivitäten bei Macraes sowie der laufenden Investitionen in die Erschließung des Martha Undergrounds bei Waihi. Zum 31. März 2021 belief sich der Bargeldbestand des Unternehmens auf 145,5 Mio. US-Dollar und 50,0 Mio. US-Dollar blieben im Rahmen der Kreditfazilität nicht in Anspruch genommen. Vorankündigungspolitik Das Unternehmen gibt ferner bekannt, dass das Board of Directors eine Vorankündigungsrichtlinie (\"Richtlinie\") für das Unternehmen verabschiedet hat.

      "190. EU accuses Apple of breaking antitrust law over music streaming. London (CNN Business)European regulators have accused Apple Galloway: to oxygenate economy, break up Big Tech Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's top antitrust official, said Friday that the bloc had reached the \"preliminary conclusion\" that Apple is in breach of competition law. The company's music service competes with streaming services \"but Apple charges high commission fees on rivals in the App store and forbids them to inform of alternative subscription options,\" she said in a post on Twitter. \"Consumers losing out,\" she added. The European Commission launched an investigation of Apple last June following a complaint from music and podcast giant ify (). The Commission said in a statement Friday that it \"takes issue with\" the mandatory use of Apple's in-app purchase system imposed on streaming services. It said it is \"also concerned that Apple applies certain restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative, cheaper purchasing possibilities.\" \"By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition,\" Vestager said in the statement. ify CEO Daniel Ek praised the Commission, saying in a Twitter post that \"fairness is the key to competition.' \"We are one step closer to creating a level playing field, which is so important for the entire ecosystem of European developers,\" he added. The accusations are the latest development in a series of high profile battles between the European Union and Big Tech companies that have resulted in hefty penalties. Apple could eventually be fined up to 10% of its annual sales if found in violation of competition rules. Apple said in a statement on Friday that the \"Commission's argument on ify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition.\" \"At the core of this case is ify's demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows. Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don't think they should have to pay anything for that,\" it added. Margrethe Vestager speaks during a press conference on artificial intelligence in April, 2021. Europe has turned itself into the cop on the Big Tech beat, repeatedly enforcing its rules and hitting the industry's top American companies with huge fines. The European Union last year unveiled formal antitrust charges against Amazon (AMZN) for abusing its dominance in online shopping. Google (GOOGL) has also been hit with a series of antitrust investigations and penalties. Last year, Apple won an appeal against a landmark 2016 ruling from the European Commission that it owed Ireland €13 billion ($14.9 billion) in taxes. The European Union's second highest court ruled that the Commission had not proven that the company had received illegal state aid from Ireland through favorable tax agreements. Vestager has appealed the decision. — Hadas Gold contributed to this article.\n",

Because as what I observe in these new generation, almost all of them are in the hurry I don't know why but they are impatient.

      "227. Gold Forecast: Hovering Between Moving Averages. Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then I believe that gold should do fairly well. Gold markets initially tried to rally during the course of the trading session on Thursday but failed to continue going higher at the 200 day EMA as it continues to be quite resistive. At this point, the market then felt to reach down below the 50 day EMA, which of course was a very negative sign. However, by the end of the session we turned around to break above the 50 day EMA and now it looks like the market is essentially doing the same thing it has been doing for several days. These are two major averages that a lot of people pay attention to, so it should not be overly surprising that we are stuck in this general vicinity. Furthermore, you have to pay close attention to the US dollar, because the gold market is highly influenced by it. Now that that we have broken down below the 50 day EMA, it looks like the market is finding value hunters underneath just above the $1750 level. I think what we are looking at here is a market that is trying to figure out where we are getting ready to go longer term. When you look at the charts you can see that we have formed a double bottom just below the $1700 level, so I think if we break down below the $1750 level, then we will go testing that area. However, the $1750 level above had been resisted previously, broken out above, and now has been retested. At this point, we have to question whether or not this attempt to form a basing pattern has started to stick? A break above the $1800 level opens up the possibility of a much bigger move, and therefore I think that is the key for buying this market. Until then, I would be hesitant to put a lot of money into the gold market, but it certainly looks as if we are trying to turn things around. It could be very noisy over the next couple of weeks, but I do have my eye on this market as a confirmation of the return could very well send this market looking towards the highs again. Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then I believe that gold should do fairly well.\n",

      "229. Many departments have made heavy blows to crack down on the transmission of movie pirates in theaters. The cultural industry is booming, and it is difficult to hide its light under the haze of the epidemic. The total box office of the Spring Festival stalls in 2021 will exceed 7.8 billion yuan, setting a new box office record for the Spring Festival stalls in China. Among them, the box office of &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; rushed to 5.4 billion and 4.5 billion yuan respectively, and currently ranks second and fifth in China&#39;s total box office. Behind the impressive achievements are the dedication of relevant law enforcement agencies in cracking down on piracy and their hard work in impartial law enforcement. While we are enjoying the excellent content quality, sophisticated production level, and fascinating plot in the movie theater, a thunder action aimed at regulating the copyright order of the film market is underway. This is the centralized action against the spread of movie pirates in theaters jointly deployed by the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, and the Food and Drug Crime Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. During the concentrated operation from February to March, the local copyright and film authorities focused their inspections on the screening and dissemination of 7 Spring Festival movie theaters, dispatched more than 36,500 law enforcement officers, and inspected 11,800 theaters and on-demand theaters. , Inspected 2,682 websites. This action was fruitful and effectively curbed the spread of movie pirated recordings in theaters. Actions to protect copyright and encourage creation continue. What is certain is that the prosperous and healthy development of the film industry can be expected in the future. Investigating and handling many major cases. The Spring Festival file this year was unexpectedly good-high-quality content aggregated delivery, innovative and flexible marketing methods, and the pre-sale stage was the first to win. &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot;, &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot;, &quot;Assassination of Novelists&quot;, &quot;Samurai Order&quot;, &quot;Surge of Crowds&quot;, &quot;New God List: Nezha Rebirth&quot;, &quot;Bear Infested Wild Continent&quot;, these 7 films are competing The box office &quot;main track&quot; shines on the road. Rao Shuguang, president of the Chinese Film Critics Society, commented that the Spring Festival films have improved and made breakthroughs in genre and aesthetic expression, demonstrating the strong resilience and vitality of the Chinese film market. Good content brings good word of mouth. While attracting audiences to enter the theater, Spring Festival movies are also targeted by criminals. When the Spring Festival movie continued to be popular, some netizens discovered that pirated resources had appeared on the Internet. Such problems have also been monitored by the regulatory authorities, and many cases have subsequently surfaced. For example, in the case of “February 19” pirating and disseminating cinematic movies during the Spring Festival in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, according to the monitoring clues of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, the Food and Drug Crime Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, and the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, the police of Jinhua City, Zhejiang The agency, together with the copyright department, successfully solved the case, arrested 19 criminal suspects, seized pirated versions of &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Chinatown Detective 3&quot; and many other cinema-line movies during the Spring Festival, and eliminated the main source of cinema pirates and seized them. There are 17 criminal equipment, realizing the full-chain crackdown on offline recording and online dissemination. According to investigations, since December 2020, the suspect Zhou and Mao have repeatedly pirated cinema-line movies in theaters in Zhengzhou, Anyang, Henan Province and other places. After video editing, they made high-definition pirated movies for their own business. Movie bars play for profit, and sell them through WeChat, cloud disk, etc., and then resell them through the Internet layer by layer when they are offline, or build websites to spread illegally. In another case, in order to attract and maintain customers, the micro-business Chen XX pirated the Spring Festival cinema movies such as &quot;The Crowd&quot; and &quot;Assassination of Novelists&quot; in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province in cooperation with Zhou. Chen XX uploaded the pirated videos to Internet disk, and send the Internet disk link to his WeChat friends, triggering network transmission. According to the monitoring clues of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department and the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, the copyright department of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province investigated the case. In March this year, the Public Security Bureau of Yibin City, Sichuan Province resolved the case based on clues handed over by the Municipal Press and Publication Bureau, arrested 18 suspects, and seized a large number of pirated CDs and USB flash drives, involving &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; &quot;The Crowd&quot;, &quot;The Order of the God of Servant&quot; and many other cinema movies and other films and music works during the Spring Festival. After investigation, since 2011, Zhu and others have purchased a large number of U disks, CDs, and SD cards that store infringing audio-visual products from criminals in Guangdong and other places, copied them and sold them to the outside world. Still in March, the Public Security Bureau of Dengzhou City, Henan Province successfully solved the case based on clues discovered by the Mopai, arrested 31 suspects, seized 29 servers and playback devices (sets), including &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and other Spring Festival files Many movie works including theater movies. After investigation, Zhai and others established an on-demand theater company to obtain pirated movie resources from the Internet, import their theater-on-demand system into a basic movie library, play in the on-demand movie theaters they operate, and sell their basic movie library to multi-location movie theaters. Behind the early warning and rapid handling of many typical cases is the result of the joint deployment of multiple departments to carry out centralized operations to combat the transmission of movie pirates in theaters, and the adoption of a variety of effective measures to severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities in the transmission of movie pirates in theaters during the Spring Festival. Early warning protection for film copyrights was deployed before the Spring Festival. On February 8, the National Copyright Administration released the second batch of key works copyright protection early warning list for 2021, and included 7 Chinese New Year movie theaters including &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; into the early warning protection, requiring the provision of content, storage, search links, and electricity. Various network service providers such as commercial websites and application stores have taken effective measures to prevent and deal with infringement and piracy such as pirated recordings and transmission of cinema movies in a timely manner. At the same time, local copyright and film authorities have strengthened the management of movie theaters, strictly guarded against secret photography and recording, and increased network inspections and piracy monitoring. According to Tang Zhaozhi, the person in charge of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, during the concentrated operation, the local copyright and film authorities focused their inspections on the screening and dissemination of 7 Spring Festival movie theaters, and dispatched more than 36,500 law enforcement personnel to inspect theaters and on-demand. There were 11,800 theaters and other places, and 2,682 website inspections. &quot;Monitoring results show that there is no phenomenon of infringement and piracy of movies on the Spring Festival file on regular video websites. Pirated content and links are mostly spread illegally through social platforms, online disks, e-commerce platforms, and undocumented small websites of the&#39;Three Nothings&#39;, and most of them The server of the &quot;Three Nothing&quot; website is located outside the country.&quot; Tang Zhaozhi said. Fast handling of infringement is also an important part of copyright protection. According to Tang Zhaozhi, the local copyright and film authorities have arranged multiple shifts and multiple lines to respond, carefully screening and systematically sorting out the complaints of rights holders and the information reported by the masses, and supervising all network service providers to take emergency measures to quickly delete the archives related to the Spring Festival. There are more than 30,000 infringing links to online movies. Including the aforementioned cases, local copyright and film authorities and public security organs investigate and handle major cases. Strengthen clue finding, actively expand the source of the case, investigate and lock a number of suspects who were photographed and pirated, and the public security organs will launch criminal investigations, pursue criminal responsibility for criminals in accordance with the law, and promote the investigation and handling of cases to trace the source, destroy gangs, and destroy the Internet. It is understood that, at present, 39 key cases involving movie infringement and piracy have been investigated and dealt with in various places, and 45 infringing websites have been closed, effectively curbing the momentum of the spread of movie piracy in movie theaters. The efforts to dig and protect excellent IP to combat piracy will continue to increase. Tang Zhaozhi revealed that in the next step, local law enforcement agencies will dig deeper into the source of piracy, increase efforts to crack down on sneak shots and pirated recordings in theaters, severely investigate and punish websites, WeChat public accounts, and e-commerce operators that sell and disseminate pirated films, and urge all online platforms to strengthen their corporate bodies. Responsibilities and severe penalties for pirating and disseminating cinema-line movies that have strong opinions and great social harm to the rights holders, create a good social atmosphere that respects copyright and creation, and promotes the prosperity and healthy development of the film industry. It is worth noting that the recent protection of the copyright of film works is also reflected in the move to increase the crackdown on infringements in the field of short videos. Yu Cike, director of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, said that this year the National Copyright Administration will continue to intensify its crackdown on infringements in the field of short videos, and resolutely rectify short video platforms and unauthorized copying and performances by producers and operators of self-media and public accounts. , Spread the infringement of other people&#39;s films, music and other works. Promote short video platforms, self-media, and public account operators to fully perform their main responsibilities, effectively strengthen the construction of the copyright system, improve the copyright complaint handling mechanism, and effectively perform the obligation of reporting on illegal and criminal clues and cooperating in investigations. Encourage and support film copyright collective management organizations to strengthen their own construction, carry out collective management of film copyrights in accordance with the law, and play a good role in safeguarding the legal rights of rights holders and facilitating the legal use of users. On the one hand, we will not be merciless to infringers, and on the other hand, we will encourage excellent works. Recently, the first &quot;China Annual IP Selection&quot; aimed at telling the Chinese story, encouraging integrity and innovation, strengthening protection, promoting transformation, and mining China&#39;s good IP was announced. The selection activity is guided by the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department and hosted by the National Copyright Exchange Center Alliance. Film and television originals occupy a place among the top ten tracks set by it to find outstanding representatives of Chinese cultural copyright in various fields. &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; won the gold award, &quot;The Great Sister&quot; and &quot;Su Mang&#39;s Covenant&quot; won the silver award, &quot;Assassination of the Novelist&quot; won the bronze award, and &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; won the promotion award. Li Heng, chairman of the China National Copyright Exchange, said that under the current background that the country attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights, it is necessary to make great efforts to promote the changes in the content, market, and concepts of the cultural industry to effectively promote the inheritance, innovation and development of culture. Achieve diversity and diversified cultural transmission, promote deeper and broader cultural exchanges such as spiritual and material; and in various tracks in the cultural field, excavate outstanding local Chinese IP, protect copyright from being stolen and changed in circulation, and retain artistic and cultural characteristics , To better promote cultural and artistic exchanges and prosperity.

      "243. Recovery hopes drive shares, US Treasury yields. World share indices extended gains and Treasury yields rose on Thursday, after strong U.S. economic data and the Federal Reserve's commitment to continue supporting the economy fueled confidence in a recovery.U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, fueled by massive government aid to households and businesses, charting the course for what is expected will be the strongest annual performance in nearly four decades.\"Assuming that COVID variants remain contained, the second quarter is set for a further acceleration in growth as the re-openings continue,\" said Katherine Judge, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.New York City aims to \"fully reopen\" on July 1 after more than a year of closures and capacity restrictions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33%, closing at an all-time high and remaining on course for its best month since November.The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. The Nasdaq Composite hit a record intraday high before paring some gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 239.98 points, or 0.71%, to 34,060.36, the S&P 500 gained 28.29 points, or 0.68%, to 4,211.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 31.52 points, or 0.22%, to 14,082.55.Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 1.6343%, from 1.62% late on Wednesday.\"The economy is going to run hot these next couple of months and the bond market sell-off will return and could make Treasury yields attempt to test the end of March highs,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.The dollar stayed just off nine-week lows as the Fed's dovish outlook and bold spending plans from the White House furthered expectations that inflation will rise.The dollar index rose 0.085%, with the euro up 0.03% to $1.2127.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that \"it is not time yet\" to begin discussing any change in policy after the U.S. central bank left interest rates and its bond-buying program unchanged, despite taking a more optimistic view of the country's economic recovery.Later on Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a sweeping new $1.8 trillion spending plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress.The Fed's stance, strong U.S. corporate earnings and the notion that Biden is going big on infrastructure were all supportive for markets, said François Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.\"The Fed confirmed the roadmap for any change in policy, which is a reassuring factor,\" he said. \"It looks like tapering won't materialize until 2022 and that has induced weakness for the dollar, is supportive of market liquidity and means less pressure on emerging markets.\"MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.14% higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.21%.European stocks ended lower as a rise in euro zone bond yields caused investors to lock in profits at near-record levels.The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3% to 438.77, coming further off a record peak of 443.61 hit last week.Oil prices were on track to hit six-week highs as strong U.S. economic data, a weak dollar and an expected recovery in demand outweighed concerns about rising output and the impact of higher COVID-19 cases in Brazil and India.U.S. crude futures settled at $65.01 per barrel, up 1.8%.

      "253. Gold-standard' swab tests will cost holidaymakers just £45 each. Holidaymakers will be able to get a Covid test for just £45 under government plans to make holidays abroad more affordable when international travel opens up. The PCR tests, which are required on entry by most European countries, would be provided for a fraction of the current price if the government's plan goes ahead, the transport secretary said. 'Gold standard' PCR swab tests will continue to be required for all travellers arriving in Britain, despite the Prime Minister previously suggesting that rapid lateral flow tests could be considered for use. The news of cheaper tests for holidaymakers comes three weeks after  Boris Johnson asked officials to consider using the on-the-spot rapid tests to make the tests more affordable, stating that the  reopening the holiday market from May 17 was a 'priority'.     Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced the news on Thursday that 'a new entrant' had made it possible to supply PCR tests for £44.40. Currently anyone coming to the UK has to take a pre-flight test and buy a two-swab package to be used two and eight days after arrival.  Official packages use gold-standard PCR technology and cost around £200 a head, this is due to fall to £45 by May 17 when some international travel is set to resume. Shapps told the Commons: 'I know that the House is interested on the update with regard to travel returning internationally and I wanted to provide a very quick update to say that although PCR tests may be required from a medical, scientific point of view, we have been working with private laboratories, pharmacies, supermarkets and other companies to encourage them to deliver on their logistical expertise and enter the market and drive down the cost. 'We've seen some success so far because the cost of a single PCR day two test now has come down to £60 from one of the large providers on the government-linked site, with a new entrant now at £44.90, enabling more people to access PCR tests as international travel returns.' The drop in price brings hope to the millions of Britons desperate for a foreign holiday after months of lockdown.  In other good news British tourists will be welcome in France from June 9 as long as they have proof of vaccination or a negative test. The announcement by president Emmanuel Macron comes as a study finds much of Europe could safely be put on the travel 'green list' this summer. The list could include up to 24 countries, The Times reports. Mr Macron's announcement will pile further pressure on ministers to restart foreign holidays to major hotspots for sun-starved Britons. Under France's reopening, restrictions on cafes and restaurants will be lifted gradually with a return to near-normal by June 30. The Yale University research showed restarting quarantine-free travel to popular destinations such as Spain, Portugal and Greece would not increase infection rates. And hospitalisations would only increase by about six a day if travel was restarted with up to 31 European countries. There are currently around 124 daily hospitalisations in England. Johan Lundgren, boss of easyJet which commissioned the study, said: 'Based on the results of this ground-breaking research, and applying the principles set out in the roadmap set out by the Prime Minister, easyJet can demonstrate that it is safe to put much of Europe on the green list. 'This is because the analysis not only shows that travel from several European countries, including popular holiday destinations like Spain, Portugal and Greece, would not affect the UK case rate. 'But even more importantly, that travel to and from Europe would have very little impact on hospitalisations in the UK.' He stressed that countries with worrying new variants should remain subject to strict measures such as quarantine. The study is due to be submitted for peer review shortly. Countries' ratings as green, amber and red will be set out by May 10.      \n",

      "257. Westminster redecorating could paint Johnson into a corner. The writer, a former head of the Downing Street policy unit, is a Harvard senior fellowBritish politics currently resembles a whodunnit, with Westminster consumed by one question: who paid to redecorate the prime minister’s Downing Street flat? Boris Johnson will not be brought down by wallpaper-gate: voters didn’t foot the bill, and are looking forward to the summer, thanks to his swift vaccine rollout. But if the impression keeps growing that Britain is run by a gilded chumocracy, it could prove toxic at the next election.It may seem odd that a domestic makeover has achieved such prominence. It’s partly because it is the latest in a series of allegations, including that ministers offered Covid contracts to friends and helped a Tory donor win a lucrative planning permission. In the early stages of the pandemic, it was understandable that urgency sometimes trumped due diligence, but there is now a feeling that too many affairs of state are being treated with casual informality. The Electoral Commission seems to believe that the prime minister may have broken the law. Although Johnson insists he has settled the £58,000 bill for the flat, he has not denied that it was originally paid for by the Conservative party, through a loan or donation, neither of which were declared. The dramatic cast of characters makes it impossible to kill the story. The poisonous Rasputin Dominic Cummings, ousted as chief of staff, is preparing a dossier of wounding information for a parliamentary committee. Ben Elliot, the Duchess of Cornwall’s nephew, was party co-chairman when a gift of £15,000 to the party from businessman Lord Brownlow was declared to the Electoral Commission; a second gift of £58,000 was not. Meanwhile the first fiancée, Carrie Symonds, whose choice of gold wallpaper supposedly sent the prime minister into paroxysms, has been dubbed Carrie Antoinette.The most damaging aspect may prove to be not the cover-up, but the snub to a national treasure, the John Lewis department store. Tatler magazine quoted unnamed friends of Symonds complaining that Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May had created a “John Lewis furniture nightmare”. The commissioning of “eco-designer” Lulu Lytle, whose colourful prints fill grand houses from Barbados to Park Avenue, feels like an extravagance which is especially jarring, given Symonds’ supposed environmentalism. Lytle may lace her curtains with seaweed, but there’s nothing “eco” about chucking out a two-year old sofa. The taxpayer will not be footing the bill — unlike the grants given to Johnson’s girlfriend Jennifer Arcuri when he was mayor of London, or the huge sums spent on test and trace. The problem is that it seems to cast the prime minister in a new light, as a man who cares about appearances, rather than the messy-haired rogue we thought we knew. Central to Boris Johnson’s charm is that he has always looked a shambles, lived off pizza, ridden rickety bikes, enjoyed a good boogie on the dance floor, and not given a damn. He has always worried about money, but mainly to support his children from official and unofficial dalliances. His mistakes and lack of pretension have made him human, in an age of robotic politicians.To diss John Lewis, however, is to attack an institution which has served Middle England from cradle to grave. Many of us got our school uniforms there, we had our wedding lists there, and we still buy presents for granny there, knowing she can always return them with no fuss. Its genius is to be faintly upmarket but not flashy: as voters might once have seen Boris. British prime ministers are unusual in having to live above the shop in pretty modest circumstances. Most opt for the four-bedroom flat above Number 11 Downing Street, and let their chancellor use the smaller one above Number 10. When you work in the building, you get used to bumping into the country’s leaders on the back stairs, and seeing their children playing in the garden. The Elysée Palace or the White House it ain’t — I used to take my turn with the policemen for the only shower-room — but it supports our belief that we are a sober nation of principle. At Chequers, the prime minister’s country house, I was once told approvingly by staff that Gordon Brown was so parsimonious that he had refused to light the log fires. There is actually a strong argument for the state to do more to maintain these official buildings. But it was cack-handed to have tried to create a Downing Street Trust to fund improvements which might in turn have saved Johnson from having to cough up. Next week’s local elections will show whether the public has noticed any of this. I suspect they won’t. Johnson has a strong poll lead and a large majority. The risk is that the drip-drip of sleaze allegations will slowly corrode this government just as it doomed John Major’s in the 1990s, when a minister was jailed for perjury, and some MPs took “cash for questions”. It felt then as though the Tories had been in power too long. Could “cash for curtains” create a similar ennui?John Lewis’s legendary slogan is “never knowingly undersold”. I would add: never knowingly underestimate Boris Johnson. But if he doesn’t come clean, and if this wasn’t the only loan, this may prove to have been the moment he painted himself into a corner.\n",

The Company currently holds the Jonathan's Pond, Dog Bay, Mt. Peyton, Middle Ridge , True Grit, Great Bend and Gazeebow projects which cumulatively cover an area of approximately 2,11 5 square kilometres. All projects within Exploits’ portfolio lie within the Exploits Subzone.  Exploits believes that the Exploits Subzone, which runs 200 km from Dog Bay southwest to Bay d'Espoir, has been neglected since the last major exploration campaigns in the 1980s. The last 40 years have seen incremental advancements in the understanding of gold mineralization in the camp. The sum of this knowledge is now coming together in discrete and effective exploration models that have delivered discovery such as New Found Gold's 2019 discovery of 92.86 g/t Au over 19.0 metres near surface. The Exploits Subzone and GRUB regions have been the focus of major staking and financing throughout 2020, with increased exploration activities forecasted in the area moving into 2021.  The team at Exploits, with significant local experience and knowledge, have studied the entirety of the Exploits Subzone and picked individual land packages for staking or joint venture where there is an opportunity for world class discoveries and mine development. Exploits intends to leverage its local team and the larger shift in understanding and become one of the most extensive explorers in the Exploits Subzone.  ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD   /s/ \" Michael Collins \"  President and CEO  For further information, please contact:   Michael Collins , CEO  Tel: ( 778 ) 819 -2708  Neither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Regulation Service Provider (as the term is defined in the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy of accuracy of this news release.   Forward-Looking Statements  This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management's current expectations and assumptions.

      "308. Cliff Walkers. Starring: Yu Hewei, Zhang Yi, Qin Hailu, Zhu Yawen, Liu Haocun, Ni Dahong, Li Naiwen, Yu Ailei , Zhou Xiaofan   Director: Zhang Yimou ANOTHER classy Chinese action thriller whose dazzling style seems to take place in a deliberate narrative void, “ ” (previously titled “Impasse”) marks leading Chinese director Zhang Yimou’s first foray into the espionage genre. Following on the heels of his “One Second,” the new film is dedicated to “the heroes of the Revolution.” What  audiences will take away is a visually entrancing parade of attractive actors in a pleasingly fluid spy-counterspy dance. The film is set in the 1930s following the Japanese occupation of Manchukuo, a northeast puppet state that was once Chinese Manchuria. The atrocities committed by parts of the Japanese army during this period were recently dramatized in Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s “Wife of a Spy,” best director award winner at Venice 2020. Here, again, the action is premised on the urgent need to get information out for the world to judge and act upon. In this case, the sole survivor of a Manchurian death camp must be smuggled out of China as an eyewitness to Japanese war crimes. The Chinese Communist Party sends in a team of four secret agents, who have been highly trained in the Soviet Union and who are determined to succeed. We meet them parachuting through the snow over a forest of fir trees and falling gracefully through their branches to the ground in a mesmerizing opener. This lyrical intro sets the scene for some soulful cinematography and atmospheric sequences that will drive the film in place of a convincing spy story. The four are two couples: the married pair Zhang (Zhang Yi of “Operation Red Sea”) and Yu (Qin Hailu), and the younger Chuliang (Zhu Yawen) and his waif-like girlfriend Lan (Liu Haocun). Zhang, the team leader, remixes the couples and they take off in different directions, heading for the northern capital of Harbin, where they are to rendezvous with the eyewitness. But first, there are obstacles to overcome, codes to decipher and a bewildering series of turncoats, traitors and counterspies to unmask. The agents board a train to Harbin incognito and wait for a signal from an accomplice, but are double-crossed by a possible traitor. Fisticuffs follow. After that, the narrative becomes intricate enough to be safely ignored, especially since Zhang and Quan Yongxian’s screenplay doesn’t take the story nearly as seriously as the staging of sophisticated set pieces. Many scenes enjoyably salute cinema past, from Charlie Chaplin’s potato dance in an excerpt from “The Gold Rush,” to a whistling tune heard in front of a firing squad that tips its hat to Sergio Leone. Yu Hewei appears late in the tale as embedded secret agent Zhou, who has to liaise with the team while sidestepping the ambiguous sector chief and head torturer, Gao (Ni Dahong). Though at first she seems like an add-on ingénue to the mission, young Liu Haocun (who also appears in “One Second”) eventually comes across as the most individualized member of the team, capable not only of deciphering deep codes but of feeling pain for the tortured fates of others. Qin Hailu, who starred in Fruit Chan’s “Durian Durian,” has a memorable maternal moment.

      "309. Full FDA approval of Covid-19 vaccines could help fight vaccine hesitancy, officials say. (CNN)As a condition of the emergency use authorizations issued for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines, those companies are expected to work toward asking the US Food and Drug Administration for full approval -- and some health officials are hoping it will happen soon. Dr. Sanjay Gupta looks into the origins of vaccine hesitancy Dr. Fauci explains importance of vaccine approval process What medical professionals are doing to fight vaccine hesitancy These vaccines have been in use since mid-December under emergency use authorizations, known as EUAs. During the pandemic, real-world data have shown the vaccines are against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Wednesday he hopes Covid-19 vaccines will receive full FDA approval \"very soon,\" and that the FDA will work \"as expeditiously as possible\" on approval applications for coronavirus vaccines as they come in. Progressing from authorized to approved would allow manufacturers to market and directly distribute their vaccines. It could also have an impact on vaccine mandates -- and perhaps sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now. The road to FDA approval Currently, the three Covid-19 vaccines distributed in the United States -- made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- are authorized, but not approved. Due to the seriousness of the pandemic, vaccine makers originally applied for EUAs because the authorization process takes less time than what would be required for full approval. Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests -- a medical product, such as a vaccine, that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency. When the health emergency is over, \"then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,\" according to the FDA. So, vaccine makers will have to file a separate application for vaccines to be fully licensed. CNN has contacted Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- the most recent Covid-19 vaccine to be authorized -- about their plans to apply for full approval of their vaccines. None provided a timeline. The typical approval process for vaccine developers requires completing lab research, pre-clinical testing and Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials in humans. That has already been done for these coronavirus vaccines. The FDA also requires vaccine manufacturers to submit data to support their manufacturing processes, facilities, product characterization and demonstration that the vaccine can be produced reliably and consistently. Once all of that is complete -- both the clinical trials and manufacturing details -- companies can submit a Biologics License Application or BLA to the FDA. \"By submitting a BLA to the FDA, a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine for use in the United States,\" according to the FDA's website. \"FDA evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and ness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency. After its evaluation, FDA decides whether to approve (also known as to license) the vaccine for use in the United States.\" Applications designated as \"priority review\" mean the FDA's goal is to take action on an application within six months. A \"standard review\" could take longer. \"When you're getting a formal approval you have to have a certain amount of time just observing predominantly the safety -- and obviously the safety looks really, really good in well over 140 million people having been vaccinated with at least a single dose,\" Fauci said on CNN on Wednesday. After all, as spread of the virus is reduced, the nation may no longer be under an emergency situation and the vaccines will need a different type of green light under the FDA. The agency is \"the gold standard of a safety and regulatory organization throughout the world,\" said Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden. \"I hope they do it quickly.\" 'It will help show skeptics that the authorized Covid vaccines are safe' A concern around authorized-but-unapproved vaccines hinges on vaccine hesitancy. If history is any indication, skepticism -- if not outright mistrust -- about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new. One study published in 2009, months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 influenza and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, researchers explored the public's willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an EUA -- not full FDA approval -- by surveying a representative sample of more than 1,500 US adults. The researchers, from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Georgia, found that about 77% of respondents would be moderately, very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine; some 63% said they would not take it. But the study also found that there were some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an EUA was safe to use. If the vaccine were administered by a public health professional, 55% of respondents said they would take it. If it came with a fact sheet, just over 57% of those surveyed said they would get it. If their own health care provider administered the vaccine, that number shot up to 68%. Dr. Jerome Adams, US surgeon general during the Trump administration, wrote in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post on Tuesday that approval will help show skeptics that the authorized coronavirus vaccines are safe. \"We should also pursue full Food and Drug Administration approval and expand covid vaccinations to youths,\" Adams wrote in part. \"The individuals who got vaccinated early on were generally high risk and willing to take a vaccine authorized for emergency use. But many people who are lower risk understandably ask if the benefits justify taking a medication that has not received the full and traditional FDA stamp of approval,\" he wrote. \"As vaccine manufacturers complete further studies, which will eventually lead to expanded eligibility among minors, it will help show skeptics that the authorized covid vaccines are safe.\" Plans to require vaccines Some organizations say they expect to require the vaccine, but have opted not to while it's authorized and not yet fully approved. \"People, when they hear it's still emergency use, they still have a little concern about how far you can go with it,\" Fauci said on CNN Wednesday. The University of California and California State University systems announced last week that their universities intend to require faculty, staff and students to be vaccinated against the coronavirus -- but the requirement would go into effect only once a vaccine has received full FDA approval. The proposed policy would begin this fall. The California State University noted in its announcement, \"This requirement will become at the beginning of the fall 2021 term, or upon full FDA approval of the vaccine, whichever occurs later.\"\n",

VELCAN HOLDINGS : Annual results 2020 - stable financial results but decrease of the net income. t PRESS RELEASE Luxembourg, 30 th  April 2021 : ANNUAL RESULTS 20 20 STABLE FINANCIAL RESULTS  BUT DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA  NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var % Revenues (EUR m) 2. 5 2. 8 -12 % EBITDA (EUR m) - 2.0 -1. 4 -4 5% Net Income (EUR m) 2. 1 3 . 6 -4 1 % Shareholders’ Equity (EUR m) 1 16 1 21 -4 % Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 +1 %  closed 2020 with a net result, Group share, of EUR 2.1m compared to EUR 3.6m in 2019. This decline essentially stems from, on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects, leading to an overall decline of the result. The EBITDA is also down by 45% ( EUR -2.0m in 2020 vs EUR -1.4 m in 2019). Net financial gains, which amounted to EUR 7.7m , were almost stable compared to EUR 8.1m in 2019, mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities. Shareholder’s equity decreased by 4% mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 (492 k shares bought back in 2020, for a total price of EUR 3.1m ). During 2020, the  continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India (571 MW), and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant (15 MW) in Brazil . The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained, as in 2019, and prevented progress of the projects, leading to an additional provision or Eur 2.8 million (20%) for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects. This brought the total provision to Eur 7.1 million (50%), considering the previously booked provisions. This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 . The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low, 40% below the 2019 generation, as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 . At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown (+18%) thanks to the inflation of selling prices. In Euro the turnover is down by 12% ( EUR 2.5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2.8 m in 2019) because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 (-41%). FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 – MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress, due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments, aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Techno-Economic Clearance (TEC), Environmental Clearance, Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo-Tato-1 (426 MW), the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition, the transport infrastructure, the amendment of the concession agreements, the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments. During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land, complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations. The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak, as the required meetings could happen only physically. The procedure could restart only in February 2021 . All the on-site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the  in March 2021 , without interruption. As of the date of this press release, the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the . However the Group’s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the  as being under ownership dispute, and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government. The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh (GoAP) will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects’ implementation. considers that, as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations, the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government. The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer. Negotiations with the GoAP, for the amendment of the concession agreement, relate to the development timeframe, but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities (still 380MW in the current concession agreement) and other important terms, have not progressed since 2018. This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato-1 (426 MW) tandem in 2020, as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA, or a non-objection certificate (NOC) from the GoAP. TECs of Heo and Tato-1 HEP, granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years, were bearing validities until on 27 th  July 2020 and 28 th  October 2020 respectively. Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA, which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a (NOC) acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW. After several discussions the GoAP refused, on 1 st  October 2020 , to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs, some of which the Group does not agree with. After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020, without success, the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021. Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities, the administrative fees, the development timeframe, the obligations of both parties, and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects. The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market. As of the date of this press release, the discussions are going on with the GoAP, but both TECs of Heo and Tato-1 HEP are technically not valid anymore, and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement (in addition to the CEA renewal procedure). The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years. No progress has been made by the  regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule. The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022, but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed. On the forest clearance side, the renewal of the stage-I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date. The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020. All the major Indian power traders (PPA brokers) and distribution companies (DISCOMS) contacted for Heo and Tato-1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond. The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions, which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower. The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs, the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies (DISCOMS) and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power. Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run-of-the-River (ROR, hence with no storage) hydro projects such as Heo and Tato-1 HEPs. Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the , a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued, imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation (HPO) on DISCOMS, setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030. These percentages range from 0.18% to 2.82% and are remarkably lower than those of solar power, currently at 10.25% for 2021. The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction. Despite the above issues, the Group’s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor. They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno-economic and environmental features. Despite long term promising prospects, the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties. The Groups’ projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row. These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2.8 million (20% of gross value) decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects. This brought the total provision to Eur 7.1 million (50% of gross value), considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years ( EUR 4.4m or 30% of gross value). The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I.4.1 of the annual report available at . Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant (15 MW) recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020, 40% below the 2019 generation (49 113 MWh in 2019) and close to its all-time record low of 2012 (24 793 MWh). However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency (BRL) was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system. But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020, the plant had to compensate the MRE system, which was in a negative position. This is why payments to the MRE were much higher, reaching EUR 0.7m in 2020 vs. EUR 0.2m in 2019. As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8.1m against BRL 9.3m in 2019, down by 13%. When converted in euro, the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1.4m vs 2.1m in 2019 (-51%) mostly due to a 34% depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020. Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets. The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes. The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60% in bonds, mostly high yield corporate ones. This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February, as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks. Since the March 2020 market crunch, the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities (mostly gold). As of 31 st  December 2020 , the bonds exposure, including T-bills, was reduced to 19% of the portfolio (64% as of 31/12/19), whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash, financial assets and financial liabilities ( EUR 104.5 m) included:  a negative net cash position of EUR 9.3 m (-9% of the portfolio) versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27.2 m in 2019 (25% of the portfolio), 19% of gold related exposure (versus 1% as of 31/12/2019), 21% of oil related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 4% of silver related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 42% of equity (excluding oil) long positions (7% as of 31/12/2019), 4% of equity short positions (2% in 2019), 1% in private equity and credit (3% in 2019).  While reallocating its financial assets towards equity, the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid-19 situation. The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy. This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7.7 m as of 31/12/2020, stable when compared to 2019 (EUR 8.1 m) and despite the COVID-19 crisis. Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets ( USA , Europe and Japan ), the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term. The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen. As of 31/12/2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars (35% against 67% in 2019), the Japanese Yen (25% against 2% in 2019) and the Euro (22% against 9% in 2019). It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure. Contrary to the previous years, the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage (see above / net cash position) The financial portfolio is detailed in part I, section 3.1.B of the annual report 2020 available at . During the year  continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares. The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares. A total of 492,348 shares were bought back in 2020, for a total price of Eur 3,131,696 . 275,000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and, as of 31 st  December 2020 ,  held 314,023 own shares representing 5.66% of its share capital. Foreseeable evolution of the Group: After the closing of this financial year, the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021:  Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects. On the short term, executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects, in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances. Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments;   The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid-19 crisis, which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio. FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 – MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement (unaudited consolidated) Turnover amounted to EUR 2.5m (against EUR 2.8m in 2018, a 12% decrease), mainly from electricity sales in Brazil . The turnover in local currency increased by 18% with the inflation on electricity sale prices. However, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency vs the Euro currency was responsible for a 34% decrease of the turnover in Euro. The current operating result amounted to EUR -5.6m (against -4.3m in 2019):  Payments to the MRE (Energy Reallocation Mechanism) were EUR 0.7m in 2020 vs. EUR 0.2m in 2019. Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0.5m ( EUR 0.7m in 2019), while depreciation on intangible projects under development was EUR 2.8 vs an amount of EUR 2.2m in 2019, due to the provision passed on Indian projects. Staff expenses amounted to EUR 2.7m in 2020 vs EUR 2.6m in 2019. The Group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020. External expenses are totaling EUR 1.4m in 2020 vs EUR 1.5m in 2019.  Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7.7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation (-9% compared to end of 2019) and its impact on the Group’s cash and financial assets position. The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group, avoiding bigger potential forex losses (see breakdown per currency in chapter I.7.4. of the annual report). This gain of 7.7m compares to EUR 8.1m in 2019. In 2020, other operating income ( EUR 0.2m ) consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years. This figure was NIL in 2019. Income tax expense amounted to EUR -0.2m in 2020, same as in 2019. The net result, Group share, was EUR 2.1m in 2020 FY compared to EUR 3.6m in 2019. The Group’s EBITDA reached EUR -2.0m compared to EUR -1.4m in 2019. The strong depreciation of BRL (-41%) and INR (Indian Currency -12%) closing rates when compared to Euro, at 2020 closing date, has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income, as the Group’s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency ( EUR -4.5m in 2020 against EUR -0.1m in 2019). The total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of EUR -2.4m in 2020 against a gain of EUR 3.5m in 2019. Balance sheet  –  Assets (unaudited consolidated) Net intangible assets stands at 8.3m in 2020 and are down by EUR 3.7m versus 2019, mostly because of the provision of EUR -2.8m of Indian assets, the depreciation of the Indian currency ( EUR -0.9m ) and the Brazilian currency ( EUR -0.5m ) despite the addition of EUR 0.7m of capitalized costs on Indian projects. Net tangible assets stands at 5.3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2.7m between 2019 and 2020, mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant ( EUR -0.5m ) and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency ( EUR -2.3m ). Cash, cash equivalent assets and financial assets (net of Current financial liabilities) have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 (+1%) mainly thanks the good performance of the Group’s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs. Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity, bonds and commodities related stocks. Finally total assets increased by 15.3% during 2020 FY (up by EUR 18.9 m), mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the “liabilities” and the related asset purchases. At 31 st  December 2020 , the Group ( and its subsidiaries) holds 314,023 own shares (2019: 146,810). At year end closing price of EUR 6.41 those own shares have a market value of EUR 2.0m . Balance sheet –  Liabilities (unaudited consolidated) Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities amount to EUR 0.7m and EUR 1.0m at 31 December 2020 respectively and arise from litigations related to the 2 biomass plants previously owned by the Group (Satyamaharshi SMPCL – 7.5 MW and Rithwik RPPL – 7.5 MW, owned between 2006 and 2010). The existing provision represents the major part of the claims as well as accumulated interests and judicial expenses. Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0.9 m vs EUR 0.5m in 2019 (due to EUR 0.3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil , due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation). Current financial liabilities of EUR 23.9 m in 2020 (vs NIL in 2019) are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities. Under this facility, securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money. This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits. But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices. Own shares, booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost, reduce the net shareholder’s equity of the Group by EUR -2.1m at 31 st  December 2020 versus EUR -1.2m at 31 st  December 2019 following the share buyback programs ( EUR -3.1m ), the capital reduction ( EUR +1.9m ) and the use of shares to cover share based payments ( EUR +0.4m ). As at 31 st  December 2020 , unrealized losses on conversion reserves, booked directly against the equity amounted to EUR -14.2m versus an unrealized loss of EUR -9.6m at 31 st  December 2019 , as the BRL and INR currencies heavily depreciated VS EUR currency in 2020. With a consolidated equity of EUR 115.8m ( -EUR 5.3m compared to 2019), the Group still has no significant net debt as of 31 st  December 2020 , though it should be noted it uses leverage (cf. the leverage facility mentioned earlier).

      "334. Financial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India. First-generation Indian migrants are far more likely to return to India annually to visit family, friends, or relatives, attend family events, or travel across the country. During these short trips, they have been known to squeeze in their financial appointments for India-based investment decisions. This hasty process usually leads to critical investment decisions being pushed aside or delegated to relatives or friends, which ultimately leads to financial pitfalls. In our experience with NRIs, some of the usual pitfalls they are known to fall into and must consciously try to avoid are as follows: Investing as a resident  Once an individual attains the status of an NRI he must convert his existing bank accounts to an NRE, NRO, or FCNR accounts. As an NRI you can open an & NRO account that are rupee designated accounts and are repatriable. Similarly, investment instruments like MFs , direct equity, bonds, and more have their restrictions. For instance, an NRIs DEMAT account will need to be converted to an NRO DEMAT account, while stock trading activities will need to be routed through a PIS (Portfolio Investment Scheme) account. The rules and regulations are ever-changing; keen NRI investors need to keep abreast with these changes to avoid falling into the trap of losses. Barred Investments  Often NRI’s tend to continue with their residential status-based investment instruments as well, ignoring processes and regulations. For instance, as an NRI settled in the USA there are restrictions to which mutual fund houses you are allowed to invest through. This is due to the stringent compliance requirement by the USA & Canada’s regulatory body FATCA. To avoid the complexities in compliance only a handful of investing houses accept investments from NRIs residing in the US. For NRI’s in other nations continuing with the current MFs may require a simple status change update by submitting the necessary documentation. Also Read: Why NRIs should use the mutual fund route to investments  The taxation web  Tax avoidance or double taxation is another pitfall that most NRIs fail to account for. Income earned in India, which exceeds the specified amount, in the form of interest, dividends from equity shares or MFs, rent, capital gain, etc. become liable for tax filing. In some countries income earned in India could be taxable both in India as well as in the country of the NRIs residence. To circumvent this double taxation burden on NRIs a tax treaty better known as the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) is signed between India and multiple countries. This treaty assists in tackling the problem of tax avoidance as well as determines the efficient method implied to tax an NRI income. This avoids double taxation and offers relief by reducing the burden of taxes on income earned, provided a DTAA provision exists between the two countries. Beyond intent, the foremost reason for NRIs to default on taxes is unawareness linked to the Indian tax laws that are constantly changing. Zero diversification  Tying your portfolio to a single asset class or even a single country’s fate is a gamble. NRIs often fail to diversify their investments across asset classes and invest in fixed returns assets like FD’s or physical assets like gold and real estate. The reason for this tunneled vision could be correlated to avoidance of the complicated web of regulations, transactional compliances, and taxation by NRIs. Reports suggest NRI investments in Indian real estate are likely to grow at 12% in FY22. The average prices of properties in leading markets like NCR and Mumbai showed flat growth in the October-December period of 2020 as compared to the previous year (2019). Falling interest rates too have caused traditional asset classes like FD’s and more to lose their sheen. There are multiple avenues for NRIs to choose from that are both risky as well as secured. Mutual funds, NPS , direct equity, PPF , and more are avenues that can be considered based on the financial goals of the investor, be it early retirement, post-retirement planning or simply securing their dependents' future. Digital Assets  The latest fad of Non-Fungible Tokens NFTs and Cryptocurrency along with its ambiguity over its legality by Indian laws are leaving investors in a tizzy. Young NRIs that are tech-savvy often tend to invest massive amounts of their corpus in such digital assets. Owing to its volatility and legal repercussions (especially in India) it is best if investors maintain investing in such assets within their allocated limit ensuring that its uncertainty or volatility does not put their complete financial portfolio at risk. Also Read: Here's a step by step guide for NRIs to retire rich  Controlling Outflows  Clearing off all forms of debt needs to be top a priority for every investor. First-generation NRIs who migrate often have loans for a home, education, or personal requirements. They must ensure to plan repayment and pre-payment of these loans from day 1. It is easy to get carried away and spend on lifestyle expenses in a new country. Prudent planning ensures you stay in control of your expenses and invest efficiently, especially during these unprecedented times of volatile markets, job cuts, visa delays, and more. As NRIs, investing in Indian markets need not be a burdensome task. Today, in the post-pandemic world processes and procedures have swiftly moved to online modes offering investors much transactional ease, even if they are across borders. The Indian markets are proving their grit and potential, it is now time for NRIs to decide if they want to benefit from India’s future potential.\n",

      "337. BOOK REVIEW | A Short History of Humanity. How Migration Made Us Who We Are By Johannes Krause and Thomas Trappe Humanity has often found itself on the precipice. We’ve survived and thrived because we’ve never stopped moving. In this eye-opening book, Johannes Krause, Chair of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Humanity, offers a new way of understanding our past, present and future.  The toughest opponent humanity had ever faced  Marshalling unique insights from archaeogenetics, an emerging new discipline that allows us to read our ancestors’ DNA like journals chronicling personal stories of migration, Krause charts two millennia of adaption, movement and survival, culminating in the triumph of Homo Sapiens as we swept through Europe and beyond in successive waves of migration – developing everything from language, the patriarchy, disease, art and a love of pets as we did so. We also meet our ancestors, from those many of us have heard of – such as Homo Erectus and the Neanderthals – to the wildly unfamiliar but no less real: the recently discovered Denisovans, who ranged across Asia and, like humans, interbred with Neanderthals; the Aurignacians, skilled artists who, 40,000 years ago, brought about an extraordinary transformation in what our species could invent and create; the Varna, who buried their loved ones with gold long before the Pharaohs of Egypt did; and the Gravettians, big game hunters who were Europe’s most successful early settlers until they perished in the face of the toughest opponent humanity had ever faced: the ice age. As well as being a radical new telling of our shared story, this book is a reminder that the global problems that keep us awake at night – climate catastrophe; the sudden emergence of deadly epidemics; refugee crises; ethnic conflict; overpopulation – are all things we’ve faced, and overcome, before.  About the authors  Johannes Krause is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and a brilliant pioneer in the field of archaeogenetics—archaeology augmented by DNA sequencing technology—which has allowed scientists to reconstruct human history reaching back hundreds of thousands of years before recorded time. Thomas Trappe is a political journalist but has frequently worked in science journalism and reported several times on Johannes Krause’\n",

      "339. Trident Royalties PLC. Q1 2021 Activities Update. Trident Royalties (LSE:TRR) Intraday Stock Chart Friday 30 April 2021 TIDMTRR RNS Number : 1474X Trident Royalties PLC. 30 April 2021 30 April 2021 Trident Royalties Plc (\"Trident\" or the \"Company\") Q1 2021 Activities Update Transformational Lithium Royalty Acquisition & Fundraising, Continued Strength in Commodities Trident Royalties Plc (AIM: TRR, FSX: 5KV), is pleased to provide an update on its activities undertaken during the first quarter ended 31 March 2021, including Q1 royalty receipts. HIGHLIGHTS Q1 saw a significant increase in battery metals exposure, in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing -- Trident completed its most significant transaction to-date with the acquisition of a 60% interest in a gross revenue royalty (\"GRR\") over the Thacker Pass Project (\"Thacker Pass\"), for a total consideration of US$28.0 million, comprising US$26.0 million in cash and US$2.0 million in new ordinary shares in Trident. Thacker Pass contains the largest defined lithium Mineral Reserve in the United States; -- A successful concurrent equity financing of approximately GBP20.7 million (approximately US$28.8 million) was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the Thacker Pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet; -- Trident completed the Talga gold royalties transaction and, shortly post quarter end, completed the previously announced Pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction, finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties; and -- With a portfolio inclusive of copper, iron ore, gold, and now lithium, Trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector, providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once-in-a-generation energy revolution. Q1 royalty payments totalling approximately US$451,314 from royalties over producing assets, an increase of 55% over Q4 2020 Royalty / Stream Q1 2021 Payment Cumulative Payments since Acquisition Koolyanobbing iron A$100,479 A$2,740,884 ore royalty (1) --------------------------- ------------------------------- Mimbula copper royalty US$375,000 US$453,707 --------------------------- ------------------------------- -- Mimbula copper royalty payment of US$375,000 based on the Minimum Payment Schedule (\"MPS\") under the royalty agreement, representing a significant increase over Q4 2020. Q1 2021 production saw 671 tonnes of copper sold, an increase over Q4 2020 as the project continues to ramp up; -- The MPS on the Mimbula copper royalty continues in 2021 (US$375,000 per quarter in 2021, less any excess payments made above the MPS from previous quarters, increasing to US$500,000 per quarter in 2022 and US$750,000 for the first two quarters of 2023)(2) ; -- Koolyanobbing iron ore royalty payment of A$100,479 (US$76,314(3) ), a decrease over Q4 2020 on higher received price but lower volumes from the royalty area; -- Trident notes the average grade at Koolyanobbing has fallen from 59% to 57% Fe since 2H20. Recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market, particularly for low-grade fines products, may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term.(4) Trident's royalty covers a substantial portion of the Deception pit, the highest-grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total Koolyanobbing reserves. Trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the Company in the short-medium term; -- Trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by Mineral Resources Limited, the project operator, which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10-year plan for the Yilgarn Hub, of which Koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component. Additionally, Mineral Resources flagged the expansion of the Yilgarn Hub to 12Mtpa as a further growth opportunity; and -- Commodity prices underlying Trident's royalty portfolio remained strong throughout Q1 2021 with iron ore averaging US$131/tonne, copper averaging $8,503/tonne, lithium carbonate equivalent (\"LCE\") averaging US$9,083/tonne, and gold averaging US$1,793 /oz.(5) Post quarter end, copper has continued to climb to near 10-year highs, while LCE prices have now doubled year-to-date to over US$13,500/tonne. Q1 royalty portfolio growth, combined with positive asset-level progress by project operators -- Thacker Pass Lithium Project (6) : In January 2021, Lithium Americas Corp (\"LAC\"), the project operator, announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project, followed shortly thereafter by a US$400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction. With the acquisition of 60% of the GRR, Trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production. Other highlights include: -- Thacker Pass currently contains a CIM compliant Mineral Reserve of 3.1Mt LCE, the largest lithium reserve in the United States, with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves. -- Thacker Pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") announced on 21 June 2018 and a Definitive Feasibility Study due for completion in 2021. -- LAC has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and Trident expects Phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024. -- The GRR is subject to a partial operator buy-back which Trident expects will be exercised by LAC for proceeds to Trident of US$13.2 million during the first year of operation (the \"Buyback\"). -- Based on the PFS parameters published by LAC (including an LCE price of $12,000/tonne), Phase 1 steady-state royalty revenue attributable to Trident is anticipated to be approximately US$3.8 million per annum, increasing to US$7.6 million per annum at Phase 2 steady-state (assuming the Buy-Back occurs before operations commence). -- As anticipated, the third-party claimant has named Trident as a party to the existing litigation between Orion Resource Partners regarding the GRR. The seller of the royalty has provided Trident with an indemnity (subject to customary limitations and exclusions) in respect of such proceedings. -- Lake Rebecca Gold Project: Apollo Consolidated Ltd (\"Apollo\"), the project operator, has committed a material budget increase to advance the Lake Rebecca Gold Project(7) (\"Lake Rebecca\"), de-risking the route to a future development decision: -- Apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the Seguela Gold Project in Cote D'Ivoire for A$20M cash. It stated that the sale \"will add to existing cash reserves\" placing Apollo \"in a very strong position to take Rebecca forward.\" -- Apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around Lake Rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies(8) . -- Apollo recently issued a JORC (2012) compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") update, providing a 50% increase in Indicated Mineral Resources to 815,000 ounces to a combined total indicated and inferred optimised pit-constrained 1.105M ounces gold Mineral Resource(9) . -- The MRE update also noted the commencement of key technical studies to progress a potential +8 year mining and processing operation. With A$37.1M in cash and receivables on hand, Apollo remains well funded to aggressively advance Lake Rebecca(9) . -- Additional geotechnical drilling on the eastern side of the Lake Rebecca deposit will assist in the outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine; drilling has intersected wide zones of high-grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the Jennifer Structure(10) . -- Apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource, with intersections up to 16m @ 4.12g/t Au and 7.4m @ 4.70g/t Au respectively. -- Geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation. -- Spring Hill Gold Project: Trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the Spring Hill Gold Project (\"Spring Hill\") under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). The approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of Spring Hill, clearing the way for next steps toward development. -- Pukaqaqa Copper Project: Nexa Resources SA, the project operator, noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre-feasibility metallurgical results for the Pukaqaqa Copper Project were concluded in December 2020, \"demonstrating better results than previous campaigns, including improved recoveries and grades. During 2021, variability tests to confirm results will be held.\" The project budget has been increased by 60% from 2020, to US$2.4 million in 2021 to allow for further metallurgical testing and environmental closure works in the drilling area(11) . -- Warrawoona Gold Project: Calidus Resources Ltd (\"Calidus\"), the project operator, is completing an integration study on its Blue Spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining Blue Spec and trucking ore to the nearby Warrawoona plant, potentially increasing the robustness of Warrawoona by increasing operating margins(12) . In addition, Caldius noted in its corporate presentation that Warrawoona will \"commence main construction this quarter\", as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022. -- Mosquito Creek Gold Project: Calidus has entered into a Farm-In Agreement with Nimble Resources(13) , the project operator, which gives Calidus the right to earn up to 90% of the Mosquito Creek tenement E46/1035, located about 75km from its Warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the Blue Spec mining proposition. -- E46/1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west, Calidus states that 'many soil and rock-chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling' and 'fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year'. -- Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Project: In its Q3 FY2021 quarterly results(14) , Mineral Resources Limited stated that 2.5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the Yilgarn Hub for the quarter. Trident holds a 1.5% free-on-board royalty over the M77/1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the Deception pit, which forms part of the broader Koolyanobbing iron ore operation in Western Australia. -- Mimbula Copper Project: Production continues to ramp up at the Mimbula Copper Project and, with the copper price recently touching near 10-year highs supported by solid fundamentals, the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment. Strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions -- Unaudited cash balance of US$7.4 million as of 31 March 2021 (not inclusive of Q1 royalty revenue, which was received post-quarter end); -- This substantial cash balance - coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in Trident - supports capacity for future acquisitions; -- In addition, Trident entered into a term sheet with Tribeca Global Resources Credit Pty Ltd during Q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of US$10 million. The Facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent; -- Indicative of the strength of the pipeline, Trident currently has 11 active NDAs under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands, lead, nickel, copper, gold, zinc, cobalt, potash, and iron ore; and -- Trident continues to prioritise production or near-production assets in order to materially build Trident's near-term revenue profile. Adam Davidson, Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented: \"The first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for Trident since its admission to trading on AIM less than a year ago, with the $28 million acquisition of 60% of the Thacker Pass lithium royalty, coupled with a substantial equity raise. The fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price, was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the Company. In addition to funding our Thacker Pass transaction, we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio - both through acquisition as well as positive asset-level progress. This bodes exceptionally well for Trident, particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities. Within the last quarter we've seen material positive updates at Lake Rebecca, Spring Hill and the Western Australian Gold Royalty package tenements. Revenue continues to remain volatile across Trident's two paying royalties, a factor which underpins the opportunity available to Trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers, to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile. Trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space, with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue.\" References (1) Inclusive of GST (2) Source: Trident Royalties announcement dated 29 June 2020 https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/trident/news/rns/story/r73y4gx/export (3) AUD = 0.7595 USD (31 March 2021) (4) Source: Mineral Resources Limited Quarterly Activities Report - Q3 FY21 https://clients3.weblink.com.au/pdf/MIN/02364104.pdf (5) Source: Factset, 62% Fe (CFR), Copper (LME), Gold (LBMA).

Key highlights of Trident's strategy include: -- Building a royalty and streaming portfolio to broadly mirror the commodity exposure of the global mining sector (excluding thermal coal) with a bias towards production or near-production assets, differentiating Trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively, or heavily weighted, to precious metals; -- Acquiring royalties and streams in resource-friendly jurisdictions worldwide, while most competitors have portfolios focused on North and South America; -- Targeting attractive small-to-mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players; -- Active deal-sourcing which, in addition to writing new royalties and streams, will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers, such as: closed-end funds, prospect generators, junior and mid-tier miners holding royalties as non-core assets, and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market; -- Maintaining a low-overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs; and -- Leveraging the experience of management, the board of directors, and Trident's adviser team, all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions. The acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified, larger scale portfolio. Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt. Once scale has been achieved, strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy, providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection, growth and income.

Such factors will also affect whether Trident will ultimately receive the benefits anticipated pursuant to relevant agreements. This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the forward -- looking statements.

New Holland Agriculture’s innovation in combine harvesting has been recognized with a silver and a bronze medal at the SIMA Innovation Awards while the brand’s  Loop Master TM knotting technology for balers has won the gold medal at th is year’s edition of the Edison Awards . London, April 30, 2021 SIMA AWARDS 2021 New Holland Agriculture, a global agricultural brand of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI / MI:CNHI), was awarded a silver and bronze medal at the SIMA 2021 Innovation Awards in recognition for its innovations in combine harvesting technology. The internationally renowned awards of SIMA, which hosts the bi-annual international farm machinery exhibition of the same name, honor the agricultural industry’s most innovative equipment, products, techniques and services. They are conferred by an international jury panel of industry specialists who are assisted by a network of technical experts. The silver medal was awarded in the “From Harvest to Storage” category for NutriSense TM , the in-harvest nutrient analysis system which collects agronomic data enabling the farmer to make informed decisions in order to maximize their sales. The integration of the Near Infrared (NIR) sensor enables the analysis, recording and mapping of crop composition during harvest. The bronze medal was awarded in the “Parts, Services and Onboard Electronics” category to the Cleaning system pressure sensors. This exclusive patented cleaning shoe pressure analysis system enables a faster harvesting speed while guaranteeing maximum quality. The system measures the pressure in the cleaning shoe of the combine and alerts the operator as to whether any adjustments are required enabling them to optimize the harvest.

Miscreants ransacked HM Meher’s house in Bommala Shantibagh area in Tongi, Gazipur on April 30, 2021 Dhaka Tribune While ransacking the house, they stole money, a few gold ornaments, a laptop and three mobile phones At least two people were injured when members of a teen gang attacked and looted a house in Bommala Shantibagh area in Tongi, Gazipur. “The incident took place on Thursday evening,” Gazipur Metropolitan Police (GMP) Tongi Zone Assistant Commissioner Piyush Dey after visiting the spot. The injured were identified as HM Meher, 50, and his son Jaglul Haider, 21. They were treated for their injuries at the Shaheed Ahsan Ullah Master General Hospital in Tongi. \"On Wednesday night, a teenager named Rahmat called out my son Jaglul from our house and took him away,\" HM Meher told Dhaka Tribune. “Later, Rahmat and some other boys took my son to the Banamala rail crossing area where they beat him up and left him bleeding on the railway line,” he added. “After the incident, Jaglul was rescued and returned home after undergoing treatment at the hospital. He later wrote a post on Facebook mentioning gang member Rahmat's name over the incident.”  “In the afternoon, Sabbir alias KBD, a drug dealer and a member of the teenage gang, came to the front of our house with a sharp knife (switchgear) and attacked my son again. Seeing the situation, the locals in the area helped us detain Sabbir,” Meher added. “Upon receiving the news of Sabbir’s detainment, a group of 25 to 30 youths led by Sajal Sarkar, the main leader of the Dattapara youth gang, attacked and looted Meher’s house with sharp weapons. While ransacking the house, they stole money, a few gold ornaments, a laptop and three mobile phones.  While leaving, they also threatened the local shopkeepers, asking them to keep their mouths shut about the incident, Meher mentioned GMP Assistant Commissioner Piyush Dey said several police teams had visited the house after receiving information and action will be taken following an investigation.  However, the police official claimed that the involvement of the teenage gang was not correct.\n",

By Jaime Llinares Taboada Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. on Friday reported that its production of platinum group metals fell in the fiscal third quarter, but reaffirmed full-year guidance. The South African mining company refined 800,000 ounces of 6E platinum group metals--platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and gold--in the three months ended March 31, it said. This was down from 862,000 ounces a year earlier, when the company undertook a material reduction in excess accumulated inventory. Conversely, sales volumes increased 14% to 862,000 ounces in the period, the company said. In addition, Implats reaffirmed full-year guidance of 3.2 million-3.5 million ounces, with adjusted operating costs of 14,600 rand-15,100 rand ($1,026-$1,061) per 6E ounce, and capital expenditure of ZAR5.8 billion-ZAR6.2 billion. Chief Executive Nico Muller said Implats continues to demonstrate resilience during the pandemic, adding that rand PGM pricing remains elevated.

Powell Says Markets “Frothy” as Goldman Calls For Biggest Jump in Oil Demand EVER!. source / The Money GPS Jerome Powell, your friend and mine, has reassured the markets that the punch bowl will not be removed any time soon. The markets constantly need to be pacified to keep this excessive over exaggerated trend continuing. Otherwise, money would find its way into less risky bets. But with record low interest rates and the promise of years of free money, why bother?  $GPS     Fed decision April 2021: Interest rates held near zero, sees faster growth   Fed holds interest rates near zero, sees faster growth and higher inflation  The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its easy money policy in place despite an economy that it acknowledged is accelerating.

      "399. Main Event – April 22, 2021: An Angle?  On This Show?. Main Event  Date: April 22, 2021 Location: Yuengling Center, Tampa, Florida Commentators: Kevin Patrick, Byron Saxton The Wrestlemania fallout continues and that means we are on the way to Wrestlemania Backlash because now we have something else called Wrestlemania. I’m not sure how much you can expect from this show, but you can almost guarantee who you are going to see doing it. Let’s get to it. Here are last week’s results if you need a recap. Opening sequence. Mansoor vs. Akira Tozawa Tozawa takes him down into a chinlock and then switches over to a headlock. That’s reversed into a cradle so they get back up and run the ropes, with Mansoor dropping down three times in a row. Tozawa eventually trips over him but is right back with a Shining Wizard for two. The backsplash gets the same and, with both of them sitting, they chop it out. It’s Tozawa getting the better of things and grabs a chinlock but Mansoor fights back up with a spinebuster. The DDT gives Mansoor two so Tozawa sends him to the apron, allowing Mansoor to come back with the slingshot neckbreaker for the pin at 5:33. Rating: C. Just another Mansoor win here as the winning streak continues as we move towards another Saudi Arabia show. I’m not sure if it is going to be anything noteworthy in the end but Mansoor is having good enough matches against decent opponents. It would be nice if that meant something before they go overseas again, but I would be stunned if we saw that. Quick look at Roman Reigns retaining at Wrestlemania. From Smackdown. Here is Roman Reigns, flanked by Jey Uso and Paul Heyman. After looking around for a bit, Reigns has Heyman explain the kind of competition he had to face. Heyman explains who Daniel Bryan and Edge are, allowing Reigns to talk about how no one is on his level. He has done everything he was asked to do and stacked up the competition to pin them both at once. With that out of the way, cut the check and fire up the jet. Reigns goes to leave but here’s Cesaro to interrupt, which gets Reigns’ attention. He leaves anyway as Cesaro stares him all the way to Wrestlemania: Backlash . From Smackdown. Cesaro vs. Jey Uso Uso sends him into the ropes to start but Cesaro gets in a quick slam to take over. Cesaro takes him to the apron and goes after Cesaro’s hand but gets knocked to the floor. The dive off of the apron drops Uso and we take a break. We come back with Uso work working on the arm to try and keep Cesaro down. Uso goes up but gets caught with a dropkick. A gutwrench superplex gives Cesaro two and he cartwheels out of an armdrag. Cesaro nails a springboard uppercut and McAfee is rather impressed. Uso is back with a pop up neckbreaker for two but Cesaro nails a discus lariat. The Swing goes on but here is Seth Rollins to jump Cesaro for the DQ at 11:10. Rating: C+. Good enough while it lasted but they telegraphed the ending the entire night with the UFO clip. That isn’t a terrible thing, but it also didn’t give us the most drama. Cesaro is looking primed for a one off shot against Reigns, but it also might be better to have him beat Rollins again first. Reigns isn’t going to lose to Cesaro, so building him up a bit more first is a good way to make Wrestlemania not seem like a fluke. Post match Rollins lays him out and shouts that Cesaro got lucky. The sooner Cesaro figures that out, the better it is for him. Quick look at Drew McIntyre winning a triple threat to become the new #1 contender to Bobby Lashley but getting laid out by Mace and T-Bar. From Raw. Here is Drew McIntyre to get things going. We get a recap of him winning a triple threat match last week to become #1 contender to Bobby Lashley. After the win, he was attacked by Mace and T-Bar, with MVP looking on in approval. With the recap of last week out of the way, McIntyre recaps last week. McIntyre gets to Mace and T-Bar, but he doesn’t believe that they are the masterminds here. That would be MVP, which has McIntyre wondering if Mace and T-Bar are going to start wearing those nice suits. Cue MVP, who implies he didn’t know anything about it, causing Drew to mock him for suggesting he didn’t know anything about it. MVP says Lashley is expecting McIntyre to be a worthy challenger at Wrestlemania Backlash. As for Mace and T-Bar, Lashley recently decided to downsize the Hurt Business, so why would he need those two after he already beat McIntyre at Wrestlemania? Mace and T-Bar have ZERO affiliation with the Hurt Business. McIntyre doesn’t seem to buy it but here are Mace and T-Bar to jump him again. The double sitout chokeslam drops McIntyre and the two walk past MVP, who doesn’t really respond. From Raw. Drew McIntyre vs. Mace/T-Bar No partner for McIntyre, who charges at T-Bar and hammers away to start. A kick to the face sets up a battle over a suplex with McIntyre pulling it off for two. MVP is watching in the back as Mace comes in to unload on McIntyre in the corner. Some running knees put McIntyre down and we hit the chinlock….and go to a wide shot to show off the Thunderdome for some reason (ala Vince McMahon in the mid 90s pay per views). Mace suplexes him for two but McIntyre hits T-Bar with a spinebuster for two. The Glasgow Kiss slows T-Bar down but Mace’s distraction lets the double teaming begin. The referee throws it out at 5:57. Rating: C-. This didn’t have time to go very far but at least Mace and T-Bar didn’t get pinned right out of the box. It isn’t a win, but they lost because they were beating McIntyre up instead of a result of the opposite. I’m still curious about where this goes, though I have next to no confidence in it going anywhere positive for them in the long term. Immediately after the bell, here’s Braun Strowman to clear off not Retribution. Load up the tag match. Braun Strowman/Drew McIntyre vs. T-Bar/Mace Yeah you knew it was coming as soon as the music hit. Strowman powers out of a headlock to start and then runs Mace over with a shoulder. Drew certainly likes that and Braun forearms Mace down. T-Bar comes in and is pounded down into the corner as well. A Mace distraction lets T-Bar get in a chop block though and we hit the reverse chinlock. T-Bar knees him in the back and grabs another chinlock but Strowman backdrops his way to freedom. The hot tag brings in McIntyre to pick up the pace, including an overhead belly to belly to Mace. There’s a jumping neckbreaker into McIntyre’s nip up….and there goes Mace’s mask. Commentary doesn’t seem to recognize him as a former member of their family, even as McIntyre hits him with the mask for the DQ at 5:24. Rating: C-. Just a tag match here but losing the mask might get rid of a little bit of the Retribution stigma. Again, this is better than the team getting pinned, though it still isn’t exactly the best way to make them seem like big stars either. They went with another tag formula match here and that was fine, though it would be nice to see Mace and T-Bar pin someone. Like, ever. Post match Strowman rips off T-Bar’s mask and knocks him outside as well. The start of non Retribution’s theme sounds like Neville’s NXT music. Stills of Bianca Belair winning the Smackdown Women’s Title at Wrestlemania. From Smackdown. Here are the Street Profits to take part in Bianca Belair’s championship celebration. Back from a break with the Profits talking about how Wrestlemania was a night to remember but there was one match that stood out about the others. We get a video on Belair beating Sasha Banks to win the SmackDown Women’s Title, including the media attention that followed. Montez Ford talks about how special that was and brings out Belair to for the big presentation as champion. Belair takes her time soaking in a loud EST chant and says she can’t believe she got here. If you told her she would be here with this title….well she probably would have said yes, because that is who she is. You should never apologize for being the b-e-s-t because if you can dream it, you can do it. Then there is Sasha Banks, who pushed her like no one ever has and both of them made history. They both did, but Belair is the champ. The title is for everyone who believed in her and they are just getting started creating history. They all hug but Belair tells Ford to get back to business, because it’s time to get some more gold. Lince Dorado vs. Drew Gulak Gran Metalik is here with Lince. They go to the mat to start and get nowhere so let’s have a standoff instead. Gulak takes him down by the leg and grabs a hammerlock. That’s broken up so Gulak takes him down into a chinlock instead. Dorado is back up again and snaps off a running hurricanrana so Gulak plants him with a side slam. We take a break and come back with commentary explaining that there is a wager on the match: if Gulak wins, he gets $1000 but if he loses, he has to wash the House Party’s laundry. I’m not sure if I should be more amazed by there being an actual angle or by commentary forgetting to mention that until a few minutes into the match. Anyway, Gulak hits a sitout powerbomb for two and we’re back in the chinlock. Dorado fights up and gets two off a backslide, followed by a Lionsault press for two more. There’s a faceplant for the third two in a row but Gulak electric chair faceplants him into something like an STF. With that broken up, Dorado hits a superkick into the shooting star press for the pin at 10:46. Rating: C+. Good stuff here, which shouldn’t be surprising. Ignoring the match though, while it was a low level idea, just having SOMETHING on this match made it feel more important. I can’t imagine this took more than ten seconds to put together and if they throw in a quick vignette or promo to pay it off next week, great. I can’t imagine it is that hard to ask the wrestlers to come up with some idea like this one and it at least made the match feel a tiny bit important. No it probably won’t last but I’ll take it. We recap Charlotte’s return, followed by her costing Asuka a title shot against Rhea Ripley. From Raw. Here is Charlotte for a chat. She is tired of the lack of respect from the women’s locker room. Wrestlemania was taken away from her and that just wasn’t fair. She can beat Asuka and Rhea Ripley on the same night, so tonight Asuka is getting taken out as Ripley sees what Charlotte can do. Cue Asuka and Ripley, with the latter being willing to take Charlotte up on her offer, even though Asuka is beating her tonight. Asuka goes to say something but Charlotte cuts her off and condescendingly reminds her of the Wrestlemania match. Asuka promises to beat her tonight, “b****”. I would pay a good bit of money to come up with any new way to present Charlotte other than the “I’m better than all of you” heel. And From Raw. Asuka vs. Charlotte Rhea Ripley comes out to watch as Charlotte grabs a headlock. They fall out to the floor in a heap though and it’s off to an early break. Back with Charlotte hammering away but Asuka scores with a knee to the face. A Shining Wizard (leg kick according to Virk, as the completely understandable learning curve continues) drops Charlotte but what looked like a Codebreaker completely misses. Thankfully commentary doesn’t try to hide it as they slug it out from their knees. Charlotte is up with a spear for two and then heads to the apron. Asuka’s kick to the ribs is blocked and Charlotte wrenches on the knee as long as she can. Back in and the Asuka Lock sends Charlotte to the ropes so she takes Asuka’s bad leg out again. The Figure Eight goes on but Ripley breaks it up, meaning the fight is on. Asuka kicks Charlotte in the arm and crucifixes her for the pin at 9:16, though Charlotte’s shoulder was a bit off the mat. Rating: C+. I know Charlotte loses here and it seems to set up Asuka vs. Ripley II, but come on. You know Charlotte is getting in that title match because that is what Charlotte does almost every single time. It’s going to happen no matter what and it wouldn’t shock me to see her win the title again. I would certainly hope not, but it isn’t like it would be unprecedented. Post match Charlotte yells at the referee and beats him down, even continuing as other referees come out to yell at her. Overall Rating: C+. I liked the original stuff more than usual (because it had a little bonus for the first time in….well years) but the rest of the show just brought up how dull Raw has been. The big Charlotte features at the end were hard to watch and the only saving grace is that it isn’t Mandy Rose/Dana Brooke vs. Nia Jax. Reigns and Cesaro could be interesting though and that alone puts Smackdown above Raw. It’s a bad time in WWE right now, and given that Wrestlemania was less than two weeks ago, that should be rather scary.     Remember to follow me on Twitter @kbreviews and head over to my Amazon author page with 30 different cheap wrestling books at: http://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Hall/e/B00E6282W6 AND R emember to check out Wrestlingrumors.net for all of your wrestling headline needs .\n",

      "431. Industrial Investment: Gold plummets or peaks, Canadian dollar is as strong as open. Fundamentals On April 30, the US dollar repaired the decline after the Fed&#39;s interest rate resolution on Thursday, and further expanded its gains after the strong US GDP data. Although it gave up some of the gains late in the trading session, it still closed the day. Data show that the United States&#39; actual annualized GDP in the first quarter of this year increased by 6.4% from the initial value, setting the best GDP record since 2003Q3, but it was lower than the estimated value of 6.7% and the previous value of 4.3%. The data confirms that the US economy is rebounding faster than other major countries, stimulated by vaccination, economic reopening and more loose fiscal policies. However, given that the Fed has firmly stated earlier, it is too early to consider the gradual withdrawal of emergency aid. A single U.S. economic data may have limited boost to the dollar, unless more economic data prompts the market to believe that the Fed will have to change its current easing stance soon. The Canadian dollar has performed strongly among non-US currencies, thanks to the Central Bank of Canada&#39;s interest rate decision this month, not only cutting other aspects, but also paying attention to the Eurozone GDP and the US PCE price index. Although the US dollar rebounded slightly overnight, the overall weakness has not changed. If there is no more data to highlight the US dollar economy leading other economies, the US dollar may be difficult to reverse. Technically, the daily chart of EUR/USD pulled back slightly overnight, but the overall upward trend remained intact. Pay attention to the 5-day moving average support. The 4-hour chart is in a narrow range and remains bullish. The hourly chart corrected the previous day&#39;s gains, but the strength was not strong. It is recommended to operate cautiously during the day and maintain the above 1.2100 to continue to be bullish. Support level: 1.2100 1.2070 1.2050 Resistance level: 1.2150 1.2180 1.2200 The rebound momentum of the daily chart of GBP/USD since the 1.3667 low point remains intact, but short-term action is not strong. The 4-hour chart is finishing at a high rebound and is still expected to break through. The hourly chart has little volatility overnight, and there are still upside opportunities. In the day, it is recommended to go long above 1.3920, and follow up above 1.3975. Support level: 1.3920 1.3900 1.3860 Resistance level: 1.3975 1.4000 1.4020 USD/JPY daily chart upside signs of resistance at the 50-day moving average line, pay attention to the resistance of this line. The 4-hour chart tests the 109.20 line, and only a break above that can open up further upside space. The hourly chart as a whole sees a saw below 109.00, lacking direction. It is recommended to pay attention to the performance of 109.05 in the day to determine the further direction. Support level: 108.75 108.55 108.25 resistance level: 109.05 109.25 109.50 The golden daily chart repeatedly encounters the suppression of the 100-day moving average and has a bearish sign, but it needs to effectively break below the 20-day moving average to open up further downside space. In the 4-hour chart, support is looming on the 1765 front line, and the overall trend is still weak. The hourly chart is corrected after the big Yinxian, and it is still bearish. It is recommended to go short below 1780 in the day and follow up below 1762. Support level: 1762 1752 1737 Resistance level: 1780 1785 1795 The stochastic indicator on the daily chart maintains a downward trend, and the sideways trend below 26.60 is bearish. The 4-hour chart was repeatedly blocked at 26.50, but it needs to break below 25.75 to open up further downside space. After the hourly chart, the correction is blocked by MA200, which is still bearish. It is recommended to go short below 26.15 in the day and follow up below 25.75. Support levels: 25.75 25.40 24.70 Resistance levels: 26.15 26.50 26.65\n",

      "433. Nornickel plans to adopt new ecology strategy in 2021. Investments are expected to exceed $5.5 billion TASS, April 30. Nornickel plans to adopt a new ecology strategy in 2021, where investments will exceed $5.5 billion, the company’s white paper, a report on the fuel spill in May 2020, reads. On April 29, the company published an annual sustainability report, which outlines the Norilsk incident’s chronology, clean-up and response, as well as various studies which the company organized after the accident, and plans for ecology and social events and internal changes. Nornickel has drafted an ecology strategy, which the Board of Directors may adopt within 2021, the company said. According to the document, Nornickel plans investments of $3.6 billion in cutting emissions, $1.1 in preservation of water resources, $0.6 billion - in reducing damage from tailing and waste dumps, $0.3 billion - in rehabilitation of all land affected by construction and mining. Nornickel will also invest in efforts to fight climate change and preserve biological diversity (investments to be determined within 2021). \"On 29 May, 2020, a diesel fuel storage tank at HPP-3 of NTEK JSC in the Kayerkan District of Norilsk failed due to unsealing, with 21,200 tonnes of fuel flowing out of the tank, going beyond the bunding, and getting into the pit, on the adjacent area, and into the Bezymyanny Stream,\" Nornickel’s document reads. \"Further through the Bezymyanny Stream and the Daldykan River, the spill reached the Ambarnaya River, where it was contained by protective booms, which prevented the diesel fuel from getting into Lake Pyasino.\" The company was charged with damage to the environment and has paid fully the fine of 146 billion rubles ($13.4 billion).  About company  Norilsk Nickel is the world’s largest producer of refined nickel and palladium and a leading producer of platinum, cobalt, copper and rhodium. The company also produces gold, silver, iridium, selenium, ruthenium and tellurium. The company’s units are located in the Norilsk Industrial District, on the Kola Peninsula and in Chita region in Russia as well as in Finland and South Africa.\n",

      "436. U.S .Stocks May Give Back Ground In Early Trading. (RTTNews) - After ending the previous session mostly higher, stocks may move back to the downside in early trading on Friday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by 172 points. Profit taking may contribute to initial weakness on Wall Street after the upward move seen on Thursday lifted the S&P 500 to a new record closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also reached a record intraday high during yesterday's trading but pulled back and ended the session only modestly higher. A steep drop by shares of Twitter (TWTR) may weigh on the markets, with the social media giant plunging by 13.4 percent in pre-market trading. The nosedive by Twitter comes after the company reported better than expected first quarter results but provided disappointing guidance. On the other hand, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are likely to see initial strength after the online retail giant reported first quarter earnings that far exceeded analyst estimates. Early negative sentiment may be partly offset by a report from the Commerce Department showing personal income skyrocketed in March amid the distribution of another round of stimulus checks. The Commerce Department said personal income soared by 21.1 percent in March after plunging by a revised 7.0 percent in February. Economists had expected personal income to spike by 20.3 percent compared to the 7.1 percent slump originally reported for the previous month. The report also showed personal spending jumped by 4.2 percent in March following a 1.0 percent decrease in February. Personal spending was expected to surge up by 4.1 percent. Just after the start of trading, MNI Indicators is scheduled to release its report on Chicago-area business activity in the month of April. The Chicago business barometer is expected to edge down to 65.0 in April from 66.3 in March, but a reading above 50 would still indicate growth. The University of Michigan is also scheduled to release its revised reading on consumer sentiment in the month of April. The consumer sentiment index for April is currently expected to be upwardly revised to 87.5 from the preliminary reading of 86.5, which was up from 84.9 in March. Stocks showed wild fluctuations over the course of the trading session on Thursday but managed to end the day mostly higher. With the upward move on the day, the S&P 500 ended the session at a new record closing high. The major averages all closed in positive territory, although the Nasdaq underperformed its counterparts. While the Nasdaq edged up 31.52 points or 0.2 percent to 14,082.55, the Dow climbed 239.98 points or 0.7 percent to 34,060.36 and the S&P 500 advanced 28.29 points or 0.7 percent to 4,211.47. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index and China's Shanghai Composite Index both slid by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged by 2 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.3 percent and the German DAX Index is up by 0.4 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are tumbling $1.48 to $63.53 a barrel after jumping $1.15 to $65.01 a barrel on Thursday. Meanwhile, after falling $5.60 to $1,768.30 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are inching up $1.60 to $1,769.90 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 108.96 yen versus the 108.93 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.2083 compared to yesterday's $1.2121.\n",

Ornamental stones have embellished the jewellery designs since 2017 and the new collection twirls with malachite, carnelian and turquoise on rose gold pieces. Each stone brings its positive energy and vibrant colour to the designs. Malachite radiates with flowing lines in shades of green while carnelian carries a lucky deep red and turquoise is in a protective blue with healing properties. Luck pendants can be worn on the stone or the rose gold side with an engraving of a special date or initials offered for personalisation. Sliding pendants sparkle with brilliant-cut diamonds while the central ornamental stone can slide up and down. Hence, the long necklace can be worn in different ways, with three matching hard stone beads and two gold beads as details to the design. Likewise, the versatile earrings can be adapted and worn with gold beads as studs, with the gold and the ornamental stones beads or even asymmetrically.\n",

      "466. Originally posted by Pharmagang: ↑ Alright team, what an awesome day. This was a huge derisk in a single announcement. This had one of the biggest question marks around it. The results of the ARDS trial weighed heavy on a lot. Let's acknowledge how big a deal this is, a huge (75% reduction in mortality of Rem-l+Dex relative to Dex alone) (43% reduction in mortality in their own right) deal. That is a 75% improvement on the standard of care for a disease that is killing >800 people in the US per day, reducing mortality to just 12% from 43%. This clearly shows that Rem-L is an effective treatment against Covid-19 ARDS, which is clearly still a massive unmet medical need. Not only does it show this, but the FDA now has:RCT data for safetyRCT data for biomarkers (ie. mechanism of action)RCT data for a strong signal of efficacy (26% vs 42%, p=0.048 alone; 14% vs 45% in combination with Dex, p=0.006) for a cytokine-syndrome-like diseaseWhy do I point this out? Rem-L is also under review for regulatory pathways to market in GvHD. This gives gold standard (RCT) data on all of the above for Remestemcel-L, this data - as SI alluded to in the CC - will aid in FDA discussions regarding the best path forward for GvHD. The FDA could have even agreed to hold out to review this data prior to making a binding decision on GvHD - that would explain the delays. It's not the same disease, but you know, we have some pretty clear efficacy (shown by a met primary endpoint) to show we treat GvHD. For people who aren't too familiar with stats and p values, that means that there was a 48/1000 and 6/1000 chance that this data could have happened by chance, respectively. I'm happy with those odds, as will most people - including the FDA as p<0.05 is the standard for significance. I saw one dude be like \"Yea but they only just got under .05, this doesn't give me confidence\" - I die a little reading this. You are saying that less than a 50/1000 chance of this happening by chance is insufficient evidence for you to back this result? What about the 6/1000 as a combination therapy? How many times do you need to run into a concrete wall before you finally believe it's a dumb idea? smh Also, addressing EUA, this is definitely on the cards - but thank god MSB seem to be becoming more conservative in their estimates and saying 'another trial' right off the bat. The 4th point is demonstrated by the massive improvement on top of the current standard of care - Dexamethasone. Who knows, but we certainly have a worthy application.So looking forward, things we know:Surg Centre, no doubt under an NDA to allow for a complete review of the internal functioning of the company, put down US$110 million at 2.30. (Means there are probably no shady dealings considering they appointed a SurgCentre official to the board.)Novartis held out to review data for ARDS before deciding on the next stepsEach of the pursued indications by the company reflects massive market opportunities.Things I consider almost certain:Gruenthal European partnership money and trial initiation for CLBPNovartis partnership money and trial for ARDS (After being told that the trial failed, what results could you possibly hope for other than what we got?A statistically significant lasting reduction in mortality up to 60 days that synergistically works with the SoC and a reduction in discharge time. Considering they stayed on following the trial, I don't believe in the face of this kind of data that Novartis would walk - that would be insane. The CEO of Novartis even gave us a shout out shortly after 1:24: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vasnarasimhan_leadership-reimaginingmedicine-results-activity-6792709292706295808-T5Ah/?fbclid=IwAR2-ziNWC_0--gMvWtEgmrveilJmemoS25V-lWEdVtcYdMEenIGwvVm4Khk)Further SP gain on analysis of secondary markers from ARDS trial (similar to in January with the CHF results)Progression of Tasly partnership in ChinaEventual CHF partnership for US/EU commercialisation of RexlemestrocelThings I consider moderately risky:GvHD commercialisation has been massively derisked for the reasons highlighted above - but everything the FDA did with this one was weird so what's to stop them now. I think more likely to get conditional approval than not but that's just imo based on the new evidence presented by the ARDS RCT.CHF requiring a single trial. Coin flip tbh. We certainly have the data to validate it, but FDA wild card makes it too hard to call. Regardless, I strongly believe we will get a lucrative partnership prior to commercialisation.CLBP requiring a single trial. Ditto, coin flip but I think CHF is slightly more likely to land the right way up.EUA for Covid ARDS. We tick all the boxes, and the pandemic calls for it, but they're not given lightly. Is this the path to approval for the first approved commercial stem cell therapy in the US?All just my thoughts and not investment advice, I did top up though - following my own thought process.

In the case of the car I have the following options:1. from the diagnostics port under the steering wheel I can get the speed of the car from the car's electronic control unit2. a hiking or computer GPS could be used, probably anything that isn't marketed as a car GPS is OK, the car GPS probably makes awful tracks because they don't want you asking questions like \"how much faster can I do the quarter mile if I wrap the exhaust pipe, load this software patch into the the ECU and, take out the passenger and rear seats, radio, glove box cover, wiper blades, and bumpers?\"3. You could add an accelerometer and use a Kalman filter to combine that with other information sources to estimate vehicle position. Consumer accelerometers aren't that good, you are taking $2500 or so for one that car racers use.I analyzed it to death and came to the conclusion that 1 will be good enough for a project which is the reverse of the camera being described: that is, put a neopixel strip on the side of my car and generate i think high quality images at night if someone happens to be focused at about the right distance but NOT tracking the vehicle.\n",

Quote from: BIN-BIN on Today at 07:45:23 AMSince gold is more stable for long-term holding, investors will prefer to go for gold against bitcoin.Bitcoin is new, just a decade-old currency, but gold has been around for so many years over 100 years. So the two can not be compared, but again bitcoin has grown magnificently, so it offers quick returns.In my opinion, not all investors choose Gold for long-term investments, because if we really want quick returns, we should prefer Bitcoin.As we all know the volatile Bitcoin price can generate a much greater profit than Gold, but indeed the risk is also much higher. So for investors who are looking for it to be safe, they definitely prefer Gold over Bitcoin. So in the end back to each of us, because I prefer quick returns I prefer investing in Bitcoin. And it is proven that I managed to get a large profit from Bitcoin this year, because the increase in Bitcoin this year is very significant when compared to Gold.\n",

      "514. Hugging and going into pubs among rules changing from May 17. Kent hotels, museums, and cinemas will finally be allowed to reopen We are just over two weeks away from the next easing of restrictions in England. After hairdressers, gyms, shops and restaurants all reopened on April 12 the next benchmark will see even more significant changes. It’s the latest step on the roadmap out of lockdown which could see all restrictions lifted by June 21. May 17 will be the first day that two households are able to meet indoors for the first time since Christmas. At present, if only two households are meeting there is no cap on the number of people attending, but they must meet outdoors until May 17. As well as the mixing of households indoors from mid-May, indoor hospitality will also be allowed to reopen, alongside museums, cinemas and hotels. These measures will be the third part of the reopening from lockdown. From mid-May, groups of up to six people and two households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has given the go-ahead for family members to hug each other from May 17, although he maintained people should stay \"cautious\" until then. As part of this next stage of the reopening, weddings, receptions, wakes, funerals, and other life events such as christenings can be attended by up to 30 people. While pubs and restaurants can only serve customers al fresco at present, they will be able to open their doors in earnest from May 17. The rule of six and allowance for two households to meet will be introduced indoors as well, so two families can meet for a pub lunch inside. Meanwhile, these rules will no longer apply outdoors, when people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 in beer gardens or when dining outside. Hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and indoor gym classes will be allowed to open in this third phase of the reopening. Entertainment venues such as cinemas and theatres will reopen as well, with specific rules in place for venues of different sizes. Outdoor events will be permitted to open for whichever is smaller: up to 4,000 people or half of the venue capacity Indoor events will similarly be allowed to open for whichever is lower: up to 1,000 people or half the capacity. Meanwhile, for huge outdoor seated events, such as matches at Wembley Stadium, there is a limit of up to 10,000 attendees or a quarter of the capacity, whichever is lower. International holiday travel will be permitted from May 17, with a traffic light system in place that classes countries as red, amber or green on travel lists. For those travelling to countries on the amber or red lists, passengers will be required to quarantine upon return to the UK. Holidaymakers will only be able to return if they have a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of departure and will also be required to have at least one test after arrival in England. Travellers will have to purchase and take gold standard PCR tests upon their return to the UK - which come in at around £120 each and could rack up quite an extra cost for families. Yet, after Covid-19 testing firms were accused of profiteering, the government is reportedly considering plans to exempt PCR tests from VAT, which means costs could fall to around £50 per test. Also as part of the third phase of the reopening from May 17, university students will be able to return to in person teaching on campus, replacing virtual lectures. The fourth stage of the roadmap out of lockdown, which will come into force no earlier than June 21, should see \"all legal limits on social contact\" removed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed the dates set will not be brought forward. The reopening measures will go ahead on the proposed dates as long as the corresponding coronavirus data does not take an adverse turn. The four statistical areas which will determine the speed of the reopening are the vaccine roll-out, the Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations, the Covid-19 case numbers and the emergence of new variants. As of April 28, a total of 33,959,908 people have received one dose of the vaccine, with 13.6m people having received both jabs.\n",

Shares were little changed in South Korea and Japan, where markets reopened after a holiday. Futures pointed lower in Hong Kong. U.S. contracts slipped following a new high for the S&P 500. A mixed batch of earnings reports Thursday included disappointments for Ford Motor Co. and Twitter Inc., and gains for Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Concerns about chip shortages wiped out an earnings-driven advance for Apple Inc.  TRENDING STORIES   Treasuries weakened and the dollar was steady in early Asia trade. China’s purchasing managers surveys signaled expansion in manufacturing and services activity in the world’s second-largest economy, after the U.S. reported growth at a 6.4% annualized pace in the first quarter. Investors are anticipating more support from the government to add the optimism from economic numbers. President Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.8 trillion social package in addition to his infrastructure plans. And there’s no sign yet of the Federal Reserve withdrawing policy accommodation, with Chair Jerome Powell reasserting this week that he’s looking for more progress in the jobs market, and that inflation pressures are likely temporary. “All evidence still points to continued support from both fiscal and monetary policy against a backdrop of accelerating corporate earnings,\" said Mark Haefele, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. “This reinforces our view that markets can advance further, with cyclical parts of the market -- such as financials, energy, and value stocks -- likely to benefit most from the global upswing.\" Meanwhile, copper topped $10,000 a metric ton for the first time since 2011, nearing that year’s record high as the global recovery stokes demand and mines struggle to keep up. Crude oil traded just below $65 a barrel as signs of strengthening demand from the U.S. to China stoked optimism that key markets are turning a corner in their recovery.

Will get the other removed as duplicate:hey @Bazz88 and @stezzGood thread for this discussion stezz.I've had a chance to jump on GeoResGlobe to have a look at the tenements around. I went through holders of all the permits/applications around us on this results page:I couldn't see the one I was thinking of, so did a google search and found Sipa Resources, which is who I had in mind and had previously referenced us for their applications, which were immediately to our south/south west and within the inferred boundary. Interestingly, it appears that they no longer hold those tenements, or the applications were refused. Looking at the relevant page from their 2019 annual report, with their applications at the time, it actually looks we've picked up a part of them in our recent applications, see 27819, 27820 and 27821. Now I wonder what Sipa were thinking after seeing the CSIRO hydrogeochem?????Sipa and then a couple of other neighbours following:Sipa Resources:https://sipa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sipa-Resources-Annual-Report-2019.pdfEPM 27210 (and 25779, 27290)Touchstone ResourcesThis is a subsidiary of Metallica Minerals, which is the project @stezz referred to in the other threadhttps://www.metallicaminerals.com.au/esmerelda-projectEPM 27264This is particularly interesting to me.MRG Resources, private vehicle of geologist Rob Heaslop. Rob is consultant geologist to Inca Resources (ICG:AX) and, together with Dr Jonathan West, put together some sensational tenements in the East Tennant area, subject area of recent Geoscience Australia and Minrex studies and releases. I believe it is going to be a very hot province, like I expect for Empress Springs and for the same reasons - big, deep structures (under some cover) tapping the mantle with criss crossing substructures. I think Rob is probably a gun, didn't know him before buying into ICG (and also SER in that area) but he has nailed great ground that he vended to them. I must say what he's targeting in the Croydon area looks very interesting and has been optioned to North Queensland Resources, private company who have a brilliant team, this could be one to look out for when it comes up for listing someday.https://www.nqr-australia.com/teamThe relevant page on Rob's website:http://www.mrgresources.com.au/projects-william-rogersHis selected anomaly certainly stands outAlso last of all Crater Gold, who are further to the north and also referenced by Sipa, see map in Sipa snip.http://www.cratergold.com.au/irm/content/polymetallic-project.aspx?RID=310&RedirectCount=1They've been in that area for well over a decade and it's more part of the original Croydon fields as I see it.\n",

      "542. Li Juxin: After the correction of gold, it continues to fall, and gold trend analysis and operation suggestions. On April 30, there is currently no obvious trend in the short-term cycle. The U.S. Index tends to stabilize the wave and pull up, but the bullish trend of the gold 4-hour cycle does not change, and the short trend fails to form, so it will not directly fall. The trend is uncertain and the long and short rhythms change back and forth. In the operation layout, it is necessary to wait patiently for the support and resistance to be touched, and seek stable opportunities for the layout. Today&#39;s market is analyzed from the following points: 1. The market&#39;s high and low points continue to move downwards, and the short-term trend is weak; but the daily yin and yang alternate, which is an obvious shock signal; the 4-hour cycle is not broken at 745, and it is still in a bull trend. Different cycles and strengths give different signals. The market is in a state of contention between longs and shorts. You should not rush to chase up or down, but focus on resistance to support high, low, and low. 2. From the perspective of the graphic form, 1798-1796-1790 above forms a downward trend line, and the resistance is near 1788; at the same time, the resistance of the golden section of 1790-1756 is 0.764 at 1783. The most important resistance range that the market pays attention to is 1782-1788. When it touches this area, it is short, stop loss is 1792, and the profit target is 1774 and 1768. 3. The main support of the market is at 1752, which is the trend line connection of 1769-1763-1756. The line support is again the 1.382 position of the golden section of 1790-1763, but the shock market will not touch 1752 unless the price wants to choose the direction of the market. In the short term, we first focus on the support of the 1760-1764 area. When it comes to considering short-term and long-term, stop loss is 1754, and the profit target is 1774 and 1780. In summary, gold adopts a high-altitude, low-to-multiple layout during the day. Reached 1782-1786 empty, stop loss 1792, take profit 1774, 1768; touched 1762 short long, stop loss 1754, take profit target 1774, 1780\n",

      "557. Shi Jinyuan: Gold and Silver Soaring and Falling Markets and Latest Price Trend Operation Suggestions. Market trend analysis: April 30, gold news analysis: Thursday (4.29) gold technical: today&#39;s gold market is after the Asian market rushed higher and the entire European market fell, so the current market day is considered to belong Weak, but from the perspective of the trend, yesterday&#39;s price broke the high point of the rebound before the last decline in 1785, and there are signs of strengthening on the trend. But the key support is the 1762 position. If this position falls below, then the whole trend will reverse and become a very weak movement. However, regardless of the trend, in the case of intraday weakening, because the US is a rebound before the market, then the US The probability of a second dip after the market is relatively high. If the US market drops twice and breaks the current low, then it is a continuation of the short position. Today&#39;s US market operation is to consider rebounding and shorting. The current pressure on the top of gold is 1779-1781-1783, which are 382-0.5-618 after the intraday high of 1798 fell, and the high point of rebound after the first fall below 1780 in the European market is near 1782. , And the support below is the 1766 position, which is the starting point for the ascent of the 4-hour chart level yesterday, and the low point of 1762 yesterday. Gold today&#39;s suggestion is to go short in the 1781-83 area, stop loss at 1788, and target at 1773. Gold is currently uncertain whether the market trend is long or short. After all, after yesterday’s rise, today’s retracement is greater. If the retracement of this wave is lower than 1762, the next time it rises again, then the market is on the high side. Rising, the next time if it breaks the high point of 1789 today, then the 1800 will be at risk of breaking, and if today’s price retracement falls below the position of 1762 or after today’s decline, tomorrow will extend its downward trend to break the situation of 1762, then This is the reversal of the entire trend. After falling below 1762, the decline may be very large, in the 1730-1720 area. This is the general expectation. On the whole, today&#39;s gold short-term operation ideas suggest that the callback is mainly long, and the rebound short is supplemented. The top focus is on the first-line resistance of 1780-1785, and the short-term below focuses on the first-line support of 1740-1745.\n",

      "559. Razer launches the Orochi V2 wireless gaming mouse. Touts over 900 hours of use from a single AA battery; offers hybrid battery slot  Symmetrical design meant to accommodate different grip styles   RAZER has announced the Orochi V2, a compact wireless gaming mouse that touts over 900 hours of use from a single AA battery. Designed for on-the-go use, the Orochi V2 weighs less than 60g (excluding batteries), it said in a statement. The symmetrical design is meant to accommodate different grip styles, with tapered ends to provide a solid grip for when users flick it. It also features a thumbgroove contour and optimised side buttons. “Gamers shouldn’t have to sacrifice performance for portability,” said Alvin Cheung, senior vice president of Razer’s peripherals business unit. “The Orochi V2 uses state-of-the-art gaming grade components combined with unique lightweight design features, making it the ideal portable gaming mouse.” Most impressive is perhaps its battery life. The Razer Orochi V2 only requires a single AA or AAA battery to function (it features a hybrid battery slot). Razer claimed the mouse lasts over 900 hours of continuous usage in Bluetooth mode. Users can alternatively select Razer Hyperspeed Wireless, which reduces the battery life to 425 hours but ensures lag-free connection. The Orochi V2 features the 2nd -gen Razer Mechanical Mouse Switches, with new gold-plated contact points that the company said are less prone to degrading and have a longer lifespan of up to 60 million clicks. Additionally, the mouse features 100% PTFE mouse feet and a 5G advanced optical sensor. The Orochi V2 is available as standard in either Black or White colours. The looks can be personalised via Razer Customs , which offers over 100 different designs that range from different looks, stickers and colours, or even game-specific designs. The Razer Orochi V2 is available at US$70 (RM289.00) at major retailers and on its website .\n",

      "581. Treasure hunters hope to dig up 48 chests of \"Himmler’s gold\" buried in Poland. Treasure hunters from the Silesian Bridge Foundation have already established the supposed location of the German Nazi treasure. UK daily  The Sun  reported that the team is to begin excavating next week at an 18 th century palace in the town of Minkowskie in southern Poland. There may be up to 10 tons of gold and other riches to be found in 48 chests, worth more than EUR 547 million. The valuables were supposedly stolen at the end of the Second World War on the orders of the leader of the SS, Heinrich Himmler himself. Among the treasure, there is said to be jewelry belonging to German elites, who wanted to hide their valuables from the approaching Red Army, and the legendary “Gold of Wroclaw,” which had disappeared from the Wroclaw bank at the end of the war. The team from the Silesian Bridge Foundation examined documents that contained clues concerning the chests’ hidden location. These included a journal of an SS officer under the pseudonym “Michaelis” and a map received from the descendants of another German officer. An entry in the journal from March 12, 1945, discusses the treasure stash at the palace in Minkowskie: \"A ditch has been dug in the orangery, which is a safe 'home' for the delivered chests and containers.” The officer also described other hidden treasures, but the team decided to focus on the stash in Minkowskie palace because it was easily accessible. Another clue concerning the hidden chests was the letter of a German officer named von Stein to a woman who worked in the palace and later became his lover. “My dear Inge, I will fulfill my assignment, with God's will. Some transports were successful. The remaining 48 heavy Reichsbank chests and all the family chests I hereby entrust to you. Only you know where they are located. May God help you and help me fulfill my assignment,” von Stein wrote.\n",

      "598. Nigel Farage: Brexiteer, scourge of the woke – and eco-warrior?. FILE PHOTO: British Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage speaks during a visit at Dover harbour, in Dover By Susanna Twidale LONDON (Reuters) – Love him or hate him, it’s hard to accuse Nigel Farage of being boring or predictable – and Britain’s Brexit champion has blindsided his critics once again. Fresh from leaving politics, the most high-profile face of the campaign to leave the European Union has joined the advisory board of a Dutch carbon offset company aiming to plant three trillion trees by 2030. It may seem an unlikely career choice for a man who has been scathing about wind power, criticised some environmental campaigners for what he called climate alarmism and declared war on the “woke agenda”. Yet Farage said the attraction of the new role, as an adviser and spokesman with Amsterdam-listed carbon offset company Dutch Green Business (DGB), was about conservation and nature rather than just combating climate change – on which he says the science is still not completely settled. “I think people will want to plant trees and increase biodiversity through DGB who are actually quite sceptical about climate change. Equally there will be others who are very concerned about it,” the 57-year-old told Reuters. “If their motivations are more about biodiversity than they are about climate change, so what?” he said. DGB CEO Selwyn Duijvestijn said the very image that made Farage appear an unlikely choice would help to broaden the company’s message to reach people beyond those traditionally interested in nature. “50% of the world love the Greta Thunbergs of this world to bring them the message that nature is important, but then there is the other 50% … the oil workers in Texas for instance … and they would rather listen to Nigel,” Duijvestijn said. Yet some established figures in the carbon market expressed concern over the appointment. “We are astonished that an organisation that, presumably, seeks to be seen as credible, has enlisted as a spokesperson and adviser someone who has wilfully impeded progress on climate action by sowing doubt about the reality and urgency of climate change,” said Sarah Leugers, director of communications at Gold Standard, one of the biggest carbon offset registries. DGB’s first offsets have been bought from a forest project in Sierra Leone from established decarbonisation project developer South Pole but Duijvestijn says it expects to develop future projects itself. Farage’s entrance may force DGB to hasten that transition; South Pole said it was concerned about his appointment and had decided to forgo future agreements with the company. Responding to the criticisms, DGB said Farage was an agent for change who can be “a force for good” in championing reforestation. Carbon offsets, or credits, are generated by emissions-reduction projects, such as tree planting or shifts to less polluting fuels. These credits are then bought by companies or individuals to help compensate for their own emissions. Currently the market is small, with a mostly bilateral, project by project approach. But with more and more companies announcing net-zero climate targets, the market is expected to balloon over the coming years, attracting more financial institutions. Some exchanges, such as CME, have launched futures offset contracts this year, and DGB said it hoped to harness the commodities expertise of Farage, who spent years as a trader on the London Metal Exchange.\n",

      "2. Originally posted by kervio: ↑ I think the update said median age of the first set of patients was around mid 50s and median age of the later set of patients was around 69, so they would have only had to have put the inclusion criteria in half way through the trial when the evidence was emerging that age was a huge factor in deaths in order to have a successful trial. This is the big \"what if\" that might have sent the SP to $10, FDA approval, lives saved etc.We can give them a pass on not knowing that up front for sure because of the speed in which the trial moved forwards on, but I think some reactivity would have saved the day here once more was known about covid (in the same way that we found out about comorbidities leading to higher rates of death).I disagree with this: \"This disease has been totally wacky in respect of different age cohorts, and no one has or has had any idea what is going to happen to any given age group once confronted with the disease or results/impact. COVID has everyone flummoxed.\" until the Brazil variant turned everything on its head (which happened after the trial) there was lots of clear evidence in white papers about the effect of age on covid mortality. The inclusion criteria is there to stop random chance from derailing your study, so if they had say 10 or so 80yo patients that were enrolled and bound to die no matter what it lessons the effect of your treatment on a saveable demographic within your cohort. I agree with your excitement on what the results though, and I think this therapy has some big potential to show effect and get approval in a confirmatory trial with appropriate design. It's better than I expected the results to be. Expand Hey,@kervio. Good points on age effect. I guess I was thinking more broadly, say in respect of MIS-C in kids, under-50s getting blood clots with the Astra Zeneca and J&J vaccines, etc. A lot about COVID has been very unpredictable.As well, we don't know what conversations, if any, were had between MSB, NIH, the FDA and the DSMB. Clearly, someone made the decision not to modify the inclusion criteria and continue the trial, opting to halt it, instead. Most likely NOT MSB's choice, and I doubt they would have been given enough information by the DSMB to allow them to make this call on their own. I am clearly not qualified to speak on the issue, of course!LeftYahoo had a good point about the silver lining here, though - we get the full trial results that much earlier, with it having been halted. Fingers crossed the NIH, the FDA and Novartis are as excited about these amazing results as we are!\n",

Performance marketing and SEO agency Mickey Llew recently appointed Cassandra Wingrove to lead growth and development at its Australian office. She has been tasked with developing and coordinating growth opportunities to reach the company’s sales objectives of $1.2 AUD (R14m). She will also provide broad operational day-to-day support to the team as the Australian offering and services were previously managed from the Johannesburg head office. Wingrove has a BA Degree in Communications and an Honours in Psychology from the University of Johannesburg and brings a wealth of experience gained from the digital marketing sector. Some of her core capabilities include forecasting the budgeting cycle, managing the financial reporting, developing online communication strategies and providing business intelligence. She says she’s excited to be joining the agency at such a crucial and dynamic period in its growth journey, with the Australian expansion. “I am thrilled to be joining Mickey Llew at such an exciting time as the business expands into Australia. It is also a very interesting time for digital with more opportunities than ever before. Will you be based in South Africa or Australia? I am based in Australia and have lived in Sydney for the past five years. What is your job title and what does your role entail exactly? Head of Sales. I am focusing on building the foundations of the Australian Office, through new client acquisition and also managing the day-to-day operations. We do also have plans to grow out the Australian team. How you plan to navigate the Australian office through these unusual times? These are challenging times around the world, however, a silver lining is that it has allowed certain industries to flourish, such as e-commerce. There have been more opportunities for agencies like Mickey Llew as SEO has never been so important, especially with travel being restricted. It has pushed consumers to discover local businesses nearby. What excites you most about the agency and the Australian office in part? The opportunity at hand. Mickey Llew has built a reputable name for themselves in the South African market by forming strong relationships with their clients, delivering bespoke services and achieving bankable results. This has laid a strong foundation to scale the business fairly quickly and will allow us to build out an Australian-based team. What are you most looking forward to or enjoying thus far? I am enjoying networking with other agencies and business owners. Tell us more about your background/experience and how this has equipped you for the role. I have been in the tech industry for the past seven years. Most of my time was spent at a global media intelligence company, which allowed me to be exposed to running new business processes across IMEA. I was then transferred to the company’s office based in Australia, where I worked across their key account clients. This gave me exposure to many Australian businesses across different industries. I have also been involved in a sideline business of selling on Amazon marketplace in the USA, which has given me a good understanding of some of the foundations that make up SEO, such as keyword research, product listing and running effective campaigns. What do you love most about your career? I love working in the tech industry because I believe in progress. People inevitably use technology to improve lives and help others. We spread knowledge, make tasks easier and make systems more efficient. Also, the industry is fast-paced and always evolving, meaning that there is always something new to learn. What’s at the top of your to-do list? To start building out our local partnerships with other agencies and businesses. What are you currently reading/watching/listening to? I love listening to podcasts whilst I exercise. As a mom of two little boys, the ability to multitask is an essential personality trait. I am currently listening to Kate Toon’s The Recipe for SEO Success, the Serious Sellers Podcast and SEO for the Rest of Us with Brendan Hufford. Tell us something about yourself not generally known? I have my Springbok colours for cheerleading. I competed in two World Championships held in the USA.\n",

OTTAWA, ON, April 30, 2021 /CNW/ - The Royal Canadian Mint (the \"Mint\") is pleased to announce its financial results for 2020 that provide insight into our activities, the markets influencing our businesses and our expectations for the next 12 months. \"In 2020, employees of the Royal Canadian Mint demonstrated their ability to innovate and deliver great products in a very challenging operating environment\" said Marie Lemay, President and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint. \"Their hard work contributed to the Mint's success. Employees pivoted quickly in the face of disruption allowing the Mint to generate strong profits.\"   \"The Mint continues to respond to the unprecedented situation with COVID-19 in a proactive way that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees. We have adapted our production to be able to continue delivering critical services in support of the essential mining and financial sectors, while adhering to strict new protocols to ensure our work environment is a safe one.\" \"One very special initiative in 2020 was our Recognition Medal, created to recognize frontline workers while raising money for the Breakfast Club of Canada's COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Employees donated their time to this project and thanks to their generosity and the contrinutions of thousands of Canadians, the Mint was able to make a $400,000 donation to the Breakfast Club in 2020.\"  The financial results should be read in conjunction with the Mint's annual report available at www.mint.ca. All monetary amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Financial and Operational Highlights The Mint increased its revenue by 74% in 2020 as a result of exceptionally strong global market demand for bullion while consolidated profit before income tax and other items was $27.5 million for the year (2019 – $42.3 million). Higher bullion volumes sold in 2020 increased the Mint's revenue and cost of sales proportionately; however, the Mint's profit margin was impacted in 2020 by lower revenue from its other businesses, without a corresponding decrease in costs. In particular, the Mint continued to pay its employees and did not reduce any fixed costs during the periods of suspended or modified production as a result of the pandemic impacting the Mint's profit margin in 2020 by approximately $6 million. Consolidated revenue increased to $2,527.6 million in 2020 (2019 - $1,453.4 million). Gold bullion volumes increased more than 100% year over year and were 982.8 thousand ounces (2019 – 483.0 thousand ounces) while silver bullion volumes were 29.5 million ounces (2019 – 22.8 million ounces). Sales of numismatic products decreased to $91.9 million in 2020 (2019 - $116.8 million) due mainly to the temporary suspension of numismatic product production as a result of COVID-19 in 2020. Revenue from the Foreign Circulation business decreased 2% to $64.2 million (2019 - $65.4 million) with production and/or shipments of 838 million coins in 2020 and blanks compared to 1,308 million coins and blanks in 2019. Canadian circulation coins produced and sold to the Department of Finance for inventory were 229 million pieces in 2020 (2019 – 385 million pieces) while coins sold to financial institutions to meet demand decreased 8% year over year. Operating expenses, overall, increased 4% year over year to $98.5 million (2019 – $94.5 million) as the Mint focused on enhanced organizational resiliency in 2020 and the development of its updated long-term strategic vision and the strategy for the Mint's future business transformation.   Cash and cash equivalents increased to $67.3 million (December 31, 2019 - $65.5 million) after the Mint declared and paid a $20 million dividend to its Shareholder, the Government of Canada, in 2020. Cash and cash equivalents remain at the level required to support the Mint's operations.   Consolidated results and financial performance(in CAD $ millions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019)  Year ended December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 $ Change % Change Revenue $ 2,527.6 $ 1,453.4 $ 1,074.2 74 Profit before income tax and other items1 $ 27.5 $ 42.3 $ (14.8) (35) Profit before income tax and other items margin 1.1% 2.9% Profit for the period $ 37.7 $ 34.8 (1)   A reconciliation from profit for the period to profit before income tax and other items is included on page 35 of the Mint's 2020 annual report.   As at December 31, 2020 December 31,  2019 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 67.3 $ 65.5 $ 1.8 3 Inventories $ 57.6 $ 94.9 $ (37.3) (39) Capital assets $ 161.1 $ 173.9 $ (12.8) (7) Total assets $ 379.4 $ 429.9 $ (50.5) (12) Working capital $ 112.9 $ 102.5 $ 10.4 10 As part of its business continuity plan, the Mint continues to actively monitor its global supply chain and logistics networks in support of its continued operations.

      "12. Lucea Primary School fighting back challenges caused. THE Lucea Primary School, which provided educational instruction to thousands of students from across Hanover and adjacent parishes, is fighting back the the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  Principal of the 62-year-old institution, Yazmin Anderson Jackson, says the students and staff have embraced the changes that have transformed the modalities of lessons that are delivered and how stakeholders interact with each other. Students preparing for the Grade Six Primary Exit Profile (PEP) Ability Test were given an opportunity to have face-to-face classes between February 1, 2021 and March 18, 2021. However, the spike in COVID-19 cases in the parish has forced classes to return online. Grade six social studies teacher Francena Black is highly motivated and hopes to pass on her enthusiasm to her students. Black, who is faced with the daily challenges of keeping her students motivated, said being online requires new approaches to lesson delivery. She has incorporated different modalities to maintain her students' interest. One such method is through the use of different resource persons to teach subjects in their areas of expertise. “We find that it really gets them engaged. Having [different resource persons] throughout the day, we find that this makes a great difference,” Black said, citing “guest teachers” from the Forestry Department, the Hanover Municipal Corporation and the Jamaica Information Service . The school, which had its genesis in an old soldier barracks near the seaside, is currently located in Malcolm Heights, which overlooks the aquamarine waters of Lucea Harbour. At present, there are more than 625 students on roll and 31 teachers on staff. Lucea Primary is propelled by the vision of excellence for all. In light of this, programmes are implemented to help students become well rounded. The motto, 'Soaring High on Integrity', alludes to that. Anderson Jackson is proud to note that students have earned scholarships due to their high academic performance. “Over the years, we have excellent performances at the JCDC festival, winning many gold medals as well as silver medals in dance, music and speech,” she said. “Students are also involved in sports and have been crowned parish champions in cricket and football,” Anderson Jackson notes, pointing out that the school has showcased its talents in Spanish and 4-H competitions and continues to provide these avenues for self-expression and development for its students. She said that COVID-19 has forced the school to use the Google Suite platform, and “we have been coping quite well” Despite the challenges of poor Internet connectivity in some areas, loss of electricity occasionally and the lack of devices for some students, Anderson Jackson is optimistic that her school community will continue to rise. “Our highly trained staff goes beyond the call of duty to ensure that students are catered for at all levels and that the school lives up to its mission to provide a system which secures quality holistic education for all students,” she told JIS News.

      "14. Under-supplied metal palladium races past $3,000/oz for first time. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT.       Palladium pierced the $3,000 an ounce high for the first time on Friday, powered by persistent concerns about short supply of the metal used primarily for emissions-controlling devices in automobiles. Palladium was last up 1% to $2,984.68 per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $3,007.73. It was on track to post a monthly gain as well. \"Palladium is in a structural deficit since 10 years. We have seen above ground inventories falling to very low levels, and now the price gives a signal to investors still holding it,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. \"The commodity ... comes with very low trading volume so it can be very illiquid and this is making the moves even more crazy. This rally can continue, particularly if car sales start to improve going forward.\" Demand from the auto industry is rising and expected to climb further as a semiconductor chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production eases later this year. But Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said prices are unlikely to see a sustained run above $3,000, with substitution likely to bring prices down as the year goes on. \"At this level more and more car manufacturers will think about substitution (of palladium for platinum).\" A shift to electric vehicles may also eventually erode palladium demand, although tightening environmental rules have forced carmakers to use more and more palladium in their gasoline engines in recent years. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,769.00. Data showed on Thursday that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter. Separately, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed a dip in initial claims for state unemployment benefits. Silver fell 0.5% to $25.96 per ounce, though was poised for an over 6% monthly gain - its biggest since last December. Platinum was up 0.7% at $1,206.   (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Peter Hobson in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)    Dear Reader,  Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

      "29. Can Utah Republicans survive an emerging sea of blue in the West?. That’s what’s at stake and why the race for Utah’s next Republican leader matters, outgoing Utah GOP chairman says Share this story Share All sharing options for: As surrounding states in the West continue to trend Democratic, will Utah remain a red stronghold? Or will it eventually become overtaken in an emerging sea of blue? That’s what’s at stake for Utah Republicans in the race for the Utah GOP’s next chairperson, a position largely off the radar of a public consumed by COVID-19 updates and the promise of better weather. Yet when delegates make their selection from five candidates at this weekend’s state convention, it will help determine the future of their party and its influence on Utah politics, said Derek Brown, the state GOP’s outgoing chairman, who announced last month he wouldn’t be seeking another term to spend more time with his family. “Anyone who is paying attention to the trends and to the numbers who is a Republican should be very concerned,” Brown told the Deseret News in an interview this week. “The demographic and geographic trends are not boding well for Republicans — both nationally and here in the state of Utah.”Rewind to the year 2000, when George W. Bush beat Al Gore for president. That year, the entire western U.S. voted red except for Oregon, California, Washington and purple New Mexico — though New Mexico tipped blue on a fraction of a percentage point. Since then, “one by one we’ve had states surrounding Utah that have flipped blue,” Brown said. New Mexico, though it voted red in 2004, flipped Democratic in 2008 for former President Barack Obama, and has since stayed blue. Other purple states like Colorado and Nevada have faded blue. Then Arizona, a state that has voted red since 2000, made the flip last year, when the state turned blue for President Joe Biden. “That is a Democratic shift in the western U.S. that does not bode well for Republicans, and we have not done a good job nationally of (addressing it),” Brown said, describing the difficulties Republicans have had engaging millennial voters and unifying around their platform. Outgoing Utah GOP chairman Derek Brown looks over county signs at the party’s headquarters in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 28, 2021. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Nate Silver, the editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight who is a well-known predictor of political elections, last year said “people underrate the chance that Utah could become a swing state in another couple of cycles.” In 2017, Silver told the Deseret News he’s fascinated by Utah because it looks and breathes like a blue state, even though it’s traditionally red. He said Utah “increasingly has the markers of a blue state, meaning high education levels, big tech sector, young population. So you can kind of envision a world in eight years, 12 years, 16 years in which Utah behaves more like Colorado or something, right?” “And this was before COVID,” Brown said. Add in the pandemic, which Brown said has put these concerning trends for Republicans on “steroids” because of the number of people moving from other states like New York or California and “flooding” Utah. “The people coming here ... that may help our economy, but it will definitely have an impact on the political landscape,” Brown said. So while the Utah GOP for decades has “had the luxury of a super majority,” Brown said assuming that “luxury” will last forever could spell trouble for Utah Republicans. “The luxury of a super majority can also allow a party to be sloppy and unfocused and still win elections,” Brown said. “My concern is we may not have that luxury in the next five to 10 years. And whether that is the case has everything to do with the party remaining strong and funded.” Brown said he saw it happen in Arizona last year, where he said a “weak and fractured party focused on infighting” lost in a crucial presidential year and lost a Republican seat in the U.S. Senate. “My concern is whenever a party becomes weak and unfunded and unfocused and allows itself to engage in infighting, the day follows the night. The party will begin to lose elections,” he said. “And we (in Utah) have not done that in the last few years. We have reversed that trend. But as a party we need to remain vigilant — or else we will go the way of our surrounding states.” Outgoing Utah GOP chairman Derek Brown looks over old caucus signs that weren’t used due to COVID-19 at the party’s headquarters in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 28, 2021. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Utah’s GOP Before Brown was elected in May 2019, the Utah GOP was plagued by inner turmoil: divided into camps by years of infighting over the controversial election law SB54 and in debt, owing more than $137,000. “They couldn’t pay their bills,” Brown said. “They had just lost a number of races including a congressional seat, and the fundraising was abysmal.” In 2018, former Rep. Ben McAdams beat former Rep. Mia Love and became the first Democrat to win a congressional seat in Utah since 2012. “Fast forward two years,” Brown said. “We pulled the party out of debt within a month or two. ... The party is unified in a way that it hasn’t been, notwithstanding the challenges we’ve faced. We’ve raised over $1 million. And we’ve won almost every election we’ve set out to win, including the seat in Congress that we lost.” Rep. Burgess Owens last year defeated McAdams and took back Utah’s 4th Congressional District seat for Republicans. Now, the Utah GOP must continue in the “positive direction” Brown said. Who emerges during the weekend convention to become chairperson, vice chairman, secretary and treasurer will set the future course. Who will lead? “The most important thing for a party is to support the candidates and support the brand and have an organization that is well funded and organizationally sound,” Brown said. “For me, this election is about are we going to continue to move that direction, or are we going to major in minor things? Sometimes I think political parties can focus on internal squabbles that don’t necessarily help them win elections.” Brown said he needed to remain “neutral” ahead of Saturday’s convention, so he didn’t have any endorsements or anti-endorsements for the candidates vying to take his place. But Brown did list some characteristics he believes the Utah GOP’s chairperson needs to have, including the basic ability to raise funds effectively, the ability to understand how elections are managed and won — while also having the temperament and ability to unite Utah’s Republicans rather than divide. Unity and civility is a style of politics employed by Gov. Spencer Cox — who successfully won his election last year and has seen upward trending approval ratings. It’s also a style that’s the opposite of the leader national and the majority of Utah Republicans coalesced around in 2016 and 2020 — former President Donald Trump. Trump’s divisive and polarizing style ultimately fell short on the national level in November last year. In Utah, division and polarization is not a style that’s typically successful — and not one that Brown said will position Utah’s GOP for success. “Someone who is a unifier and someone who cannot just recognize that you have people all over the political spectrum in one party, but someone who actually reaches out to all of them to bring them together is the best way forward,” Brown said. “I think someone who is divisive and focused on their own personal agenda, not only will they not unify the party, but they will force anyone who differs with them from the party. “And for a state like Utah that may trend blue,” Brown said, “that’s exactly the opposite of what we need to do.” The candidates Five candidates are running to succeed Brown, and they range in backgrounds and demographics. A look at who they are provides a picture of the GOP in Utah. There’s Tina Cannon, a former Morgan County GOP chairwoman and Morgan County councilwoman who would be the first woman to lead Utah’s GOP. There’s Stewart Peay, current chairman of the Utah County Republican Party who’s been endorsed by Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, among other legislative leaders. There’s Brad Baker, who at 22 is likely the youngest state party candidate in Utah’s party’s history. There’s Carson Jorgensen, a 31-year-old sheep rancher with a passion for agriculture and public lands. And there’s Scott Miller, former Salt Lake County GOP chairman who resigned amid controversy last month, but for which he has since rescinded his apology, defending himself by saying he’d been “Kavanaughed.” Scott Miller Miller, who lives in Riverton and was chairman of the Salt Lake County GOP for more than three years, made headlines last month after he was accused by multiple women within the Salt Lake County GOP for allowing “bullying” to occur within the party. Scott Miller Scott Miller While his four opponents agreed to phone interviews with the Deseret News this week for this story, Miller did not accept multiple requests for an interview and only answered questions via email. After initially calling the women accusers “sore losers who failed to win their respective races” in an email last month that preempted the first media report of the accusations, Miller later resigned and apologized, saying he “made a mistake with how I handled” the complaints. Since then, Miller’s backtracked. In an email sent to the Deseret News on Tuesday, Miller said he had withdrawn his apology. “I stand by my actions,” he wrote “Throughout the campaign, I immediately addressed any and all issues and complaints and I have documentation and witnesses to prove it. I never heard several of the complaints until it was presented in the press.” Miller also wrote he’s been “Kavanaughed,” comparing himself to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the federal judge who was accused of sexual assault from the ’80s during his 2018 confirmation hearings. “I believe certain women and others strategically timed salatious (sic) allegations against me to derail my campaign for state chair,” he wrote. “Many Utah Republicans seem to believe in ‘guilt by accusation’ and seem intent to deny due process to the accused. This is very disturbing.” He added: “I believe we have an obligation to investigate,” Miller wrote. “We need to get to the bottom of this issue. Let’s have due process, a fair investigation, and let the public see the facts.” Miller argues he’s the right person to lead Utah’s GOP, saying under his leadership the Salt Lake County GOP “successfully turned the Salt Lake County Council from purple to red.” He wrote he’ll keep Utah from turning purple by seeking to “expand the Republican tent. We expanded the tent in Salt Lake County. We recruited and encouraged good candidates,” saying those candidates included women, and people from diverse backgrounds. “We helped elect a greek, a doctor, and Congressman Burgess Owens, an African American.” Tina Cannon Cannon, 53, has 20 years of experience within the Utah Republican Party. She served as chairwoman for the Morgan County GOP, as well as a state convention committee member and a state convention credentials chairwoman. She was twice elected as a Morgan County councilwoman. She ran a bid last year to represent Utah’s 1st Congressional District, but faltered in the Republican convention. Tina Cannon Tina Cannon If it’s a strong organizational structure and fundraising backbone the Utah GOP needs, Cannon argues she’s the “only candidate in this race” that has that fundraising experience, pointing to her congressional run. It wasn’t until after Brown announced he was stepping down and she started getting phone calls from supporters that Cannon said she’d considered running to replace him. And then when the Salt Lake County GOP/Miller controversy hit headlines, and she said her “phone blew up.” “I was having a lot of friends in the party, particularly male friends, who were very concerned about the message this was sending and felt like it was time for another perspective,” she said. There are “very few women in Republican politics in Utah,” Cannon said, and “we each have our stories.” But she said that story did not represent the “majority of men” in Utah’s GOP, noting she’s had “incredible mentors, supporters and donors.” But she worried that story wasn’t being told “and that’s sad to me.” “Because when women see this, it discourages them from running,” she said. “Politics is hard. Politics is a blood sport. And women don’t run for the same reasons that men do. Women run to do something. Men run to be something.” So, Cannon said she decided to “step into this chaos” — a decision she made 45 minutes before the filing deadline on April 1 — in order to “encourage good women to run.” When other women don’t see other women “who are strong enough, qualified, and win, they don’t run,” she said. “This is a difficult thing,” Cannon added, “because I don’t want to run as a woman. I’m not running because I‘m a woman. I’m the best candidate. ... I have by far the most experience and the best background.” Running as the only female candidate isn’t a message that will resonate with Utah GOP delegates, she said. “It’s about being well qualified.” At the same time, increased diversity is what the Utah Republican party needs as it looks to the future, Cannon said. “We need to have a diversity of voices at the table because we are losing that demographic at the Republican Party.” Stewart Peay Peay, 47, a lawyer who lives in Alpine, was elected as chairman of the Utah County GOP in April 2019. By day, Peay works as a partner at Snell & Wilmer, where he’s worked for 18 years. He also served in the Utah National Guard for 13 years, including a tour in Iraq. Stewart Peay Stewart Peay In his two years as Utah County GOP chairman, Peay said he spent that time “unifying Utah County Republicans, which is no small task.” When he first came to the post, Peay said the county Republicans couldn’t get along to make decisions at the executive committee level, and he attributed that as a big reason why Love lost to McAdams in 2018. Last year, Peay said the Utah County GOP energized more voters and helped push Owens to victory. “One of the key things I did in Utah County is listen to everybody,” Peay said. “I encourage all parties to bring forward their positions, then as a leadership group we figure out a resolution that works for our party. It’s not perfect for everyone, but it’s great for the party, and that’s what we need.” The emerging blue sea around Utah in the West, the changing political landscape and the threat it poses to Republicans’ future in Utah is “why I’m running” for the statewide party chairperson position. During the past two years, Peay credited Miller for “getting the party back on track, and I feel like we need to stay on that track if we’re going to defend our traditional Republican values and strongholds here in Utah.” As Utah’s population changes and as more people move in from states like California, Peay said the Utah Republican Party needs to “control its message.” “We need to explain there is so much great economic opportunity here in Utah because for 40 years the Utah Republican Party has dominated state and local politics,” Peay said. “We need to educate people about that and help them understand that if we keep Utah Republican, those same opportunities will still be here for our children and even our grandchildren.” Cox, Henderson, legislative leaders including House Speaker Brad Wilson and Senate President Stuart Adams, and others endorsed Peay in a letter circulated to delegates, mailed using the Utah Republican Party’s indicia — a service that’s offered to all Utah GOP candidates for cheaper postage. Peay said those endorsements show he knows how to “build a team.” “And that’s what we plan to do,” he said, along with his vice chairperson running mate Austin Cox. He says he plans to do that with a unifying style. “The role of state party leadership is to build a bigger tent. It’s not to divide. It’s not to offend. Rather, it’s to build a team and to get that team to coalesce around the ideas and values of the Republican Party.” Carson Jorgensen Jorgensen, 31, of Mount Pleasant in Sanpete County, is a sixth-generation sheep rancher in a family that’s lived in Utah for more than 150 years, he said. His family businesses are Skyline Sheep Co., as well as Skyline Bit and Spur, a small business that ships horse bridles and silver. Carson Jorgensen Carson Jorgensen His family’s heritage, Jorgensen said, tells the story of “why this race is important to me.” “We rely heavily on public lands,” he said, describing how the sheep industry helped build Utah’s infrastructure. So that’s why he’s getting involved in politics, he said. “Unfortunately, politics shapes a lot of these things,” he said. “Politics is getting increasingly militant around agriculture, and if we don’t start taking a key role in policy, agriculture is going to be one that is going to lose out big time, especially here in Utah where 75% of the state is federal land and most of it is used for agriculture.” Jorgensen pointed to Biden’s “30 by 30” climate change policy and said “it’s going to drastically affect the agriculture sector here in Utah and it’s going to ruin the legacy of my family.” So, Jorgensen said he wants to get involved to save the future of agriculture and public lands in Utah. “I don’t want to see the history of Utahns thrown under the bus for progressive policy,” he said. It’s not the first time Jorgensen has stepped into politics. Last year, he sent a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence, members of Congress and others detailing the impacts to sheep ranching of the acquisition of a Colorado lamb processing facility, which led to an investigation. Jorgensen also ran an unsuccessful bid against Rep. Chris Stewart last year. On his campaign website, Jorgensen discusses “expanding the tent” in Utah’s GOP, in order to attract new voters, especially young voters. He also prioritizes strengthening rural Utah, including wildfire mitigation, outdoor recreation, water quality, food supply chain and more to “bridge the urban and rural divide.” Jorgensen also states Utah’s GOP must “tackle the issue” of SB54 and strengthen the party’s convention system. Brad Baker Baker, 22, a Weber State University student who lives in Sunset, said one of the biggest reasons why he’s decided to get involved is because he’s sick of the “mudslinging, backstabbing” that’s gone on at the national level. “I firmly believe that’s not what being a Republican is about,” Baker said. “I would argue it’s something that both sides are guilty of, and as such the biggest thing we need as a party but as the state of Utah as a whole is more unity and more hope for the future.” Baker acknowledges that he does not have as much political experience as his opponents, but he argued he’s the “best equipped candidate” to make the party more appealing to younger voters and therefore secure the party’s future. “We also need to have more voices in the room from a wider variety of backgrounds, a wider variety of life experiences because how goes the Republican Party, so goes the state of Utah,” he said. “By voting for me, the delegates would get a candidate who is emphasizing unity, emphasizing greater diversity in encouraging people to run who might not otherwise.” Baker said he would expand the party’s accessibility by modernizing the party’s tactics through use of social media and technology, make sure caucus nights are better advertised so younger Utahns would know how to get involved, and consider moving caucus night to the weekend to help make it more accessible to those who work during the week.\n",

      "30. Many departments have made heavy blows to crack down on the transmission of movie pirates in theaters. The cultural industry is booming, and it is difficult to hide its light under the haze of the epidemic. The total box office of the Spring Festival stalls in 2021 will exceed 7.8 billion yuan, setting a new box office record for the Spring Festival stalls in China. Among them, the box office of &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; rushed to 5.4 billion and 4.5 billion yuan respectively, and currently ranks second and fifth in China&#39;s total box office. Behind the impressive achievements are the dedication of relevant law enforcement agencies in cracking down on piracy and their hard work in impartial law enforcement. While we are enjoying the excellent content quality, sophisticated production level, and fascinating plot in the movie theater, a thunder action aimed at regulating the copyright order of the film market is underway. This is the centralized action against the spread of movie pirates in theaters jointly deployed by the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, and the Food and Drug Crime Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. During the concentrated operation from February to March, the local copyright and film authorities focused their inspections on the screening and dissemination of 7 Spring Festival movie theaters, dispatched more than 36,500 law enforcement officers, and inspected 11,800 theaters and on-demand theaters. , Inspected 2,682 websites. This action was fruitful and effectively curbed the spread of movie pirated recordings in theaters. Actions to protect copyright and encourage creation continue. What is certain is that the prosperous and healthy development of the film industry can be expected in the future. Investigating and handling many major cases. The Spring Festival file this year was unexpectedly good-high-quality content aggregated delivery, innovative and flexible marketing methods, and the pre-sale stage was the first to win. &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot;, &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot;, &quot;Assassination of Novelists&quot;, &quot;Samurai Order&quot;, &quot;Surge of Crowds&quot;, &quot;New God List: Nezha Rebirth&quot;, &quot;Bear Infested Wild Continent&quot;, these 7 films are competing The box office &quot;main track&quot; shines on the road. Rao Shuguang, president of the Chinese Film Critics Society, commented that the Spring Festival films have improved and made breakthroughs in genre and aesthetic expression, demonstrating the strong resilience and vitality of the Chinese film market. Good content brings good word of mouth. While attracting audiences to enter the theater, Spring Festival movies are also targeted by criminals. When the Spring Festival movie continued to be popular, some netizens discovered that pirated resources had appeared on the Internet. Such problems have also been monitored by the regulatory authorities, and many cases have subsequently surfaced. For example, in the case of “February 19” pirating and disseminating cinematic movies during the Spring Festival in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, according to the monitoring clues of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, the Food and Drug Crime Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, and the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, the police of Jinhua City, Zhejiang The agency, together with the copyright department, successfully solved the case, arrested 19 criminal suspects, seized pirated versions of &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Chinatown Detective 3&quot; and many other cinema-line movies during the Spring Festival, and eliminated the main source of cinema pirates and seized them. There are 17 criminal equipment, realizing the full-chain crackdown on offline recording and online dissemination. According to investigations, since December 2020, the suspect Zhou and Mao have repeatedly pirated cinema-line movies in theaters in Zhengzhou, Anyang, Henan Province and other places. After video editing, they made high-definition pirated movies for their own business. Movie bars play for profit, and sell them through WeChat, cloud disk, etc., and then resell them through the Internet layer by layer when they are offline, or build websites to spread illegally. In another case, in order to attract and maintain customers, the micro-business Chen XX pirated the Spring Festival cinema movies such as &quot;The Crowd&quot; and &quot;Assassination of Novelists&quot; in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province in cooperation with Zhou. Chen XX uploaded the pirated videos to Internet disk, and send the Internet disk link to his WeChat friends, triggering network transmission. According to the monitoring clues of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department and the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, the copyright department of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province investigated the case. In March this year, the Public Security Bureau of Yibin City, Sichuan Province resolved the case based on clues handed over by the Municipal Press and Publication Bureau, arrested 18 suspects, and seized a large number of pirated CDs and USB flash drives, involving &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; &quot;The Crowd&quot;, &quot;The Order of the God of Servant&quot; and many other cinema movies and other films and music works during the Spring Festival. After investigation, since 2011, Zhu and others have purchased a large number of U disks, CDs, and SD cards that store infringing audio-visual products from criminals in Guangdong and other places, copied them and sold them to the outside world. Still in March, the Public Security Bureau of Dengzhou City, Henan Province successfully solved the case based on clues discovered by the Mopai, arrested 31 suspects, seized 29 servers and playback devices (sets), including &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and other Spring Festival files Many movie works including theater movies. After investigation, Zhai and others established an on-demand theater company to obtain pirated movie resources from the Internet, import their theater-on-demand system into a basic movie library, play in the on-demand movie theaters they operate, and sell their basic movie library to multi-location movie theaters. Behind the early warning and rapid handling of many typical cases is the result of the joint deployment of multiple departments to carry out centralized operations to combat the transmission of movie pirates in theaters, and the adoption of a variety of effective measures to severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities in the transmission of movie pirates in theaters during the Spring Festival. Early warning protection for film copyrights was deployed before the Spring Festival. On February 8, the National Copyright Administration released the second batch of key works copyright protection early warning list for 2021, and included 7 Chinese New Year movie theaters including &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; into the early warning protection, requiring the provision of content, storage, search links, and electricity. Various network service providers such as commercial websites and application stores have taken effective measures to prevent and deal with infringement and piracy such as pirated recordings and transmission of cinema movies in a timely manner. At the same time, local copyright and film authorities have strengthened the management of movie theaters, strictly guarded against secret photography and recording, and increased network inspections and piracy monitoring. According to Tang Zhaozhi, the person in charge of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, during the concentrated operation, the local copyright and film authorities focused their inspections on the screening and dissemination of 7 Spring Festival movie theaters, and dispatched more than 36,500 law enforcement personnel to inspect theaters and on-demand. There were 11,800 theaters and other places, and 2,682 website inspections. &quot;Monitoring results show that there is no phenomenon of infringement and piracy of movies on the Spring Festival file on regular video websites. Pirated content and links are mostly spread illegally through social platforms, online disks, e-commerce platforms, and undocumented small websites of the&#39;Three Nothings&#39;, and most of them The server of the &quot;Three Nothing&quot; website is located outside the country.&quot; Tang Zhaozhi said. Fast handling of infringement is also an important part of copyright protection. According to Tang Zhaozhi, the local copyright and film authorities have arranged multiple shifts and multiple lines to respond, carefully screening and systematically sorting out the complaints of rights holders and the information reported by the masses, and supervising all network service providers to take emergency measures to quickly delete the archives related to the Spring Festival. There are more than 30,000 infringing links to online movies. Including the aforementioned cases, local copyright and film authorities and public security organs investigate and handle major cases. Strengthen clue finding, actively expand the source of the case, investigate and lock a number of suspects who were photographed and pirated, and the public security organs will launch criminal investigations, pursue criminal responsibility for criminals in accordance with the law, and promote the investigation and handling of cases to trace the source, destroy gangs, and destroy the Internet. It is understood that, at present, 39 key cases involving movie infringement and piracy have been investigated and dealt with in various places, and 45 infringing websites have been closed, effectively curbing the momentum of the spread of movie piracy in movie theaters. The efforts to dig and protect excellent IP to combat piracy will continue to increase. Tang Zhaozhi revealed that in the next step, local law enforcement agencies will dig deeper into the source of piracy, increase efforts to crack down on sneak shots and pirated recordings in theaters, severely investigate and punish websites, WeChat public accounts, and e-commerce operators that sell and disseminate pirated films, and urge all online platforms to strengthen their corporate bodies. Responsibilities and severe penalties for pirating and disseminating cinema-line movies that have strong opinions and great social harm to the rights holders, create a good social atmosphere that respects copyright and creation, and promotes the prosperity and healthy development of the film industry. It is worth noting that the recent protection of the copyright of film works is also reflected in the move to increase the crackdown on infringements in the field of short videos. Yu Cike, director of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, said that this year the National Copyright Administration will continue to intensify its crackdown on infringements in the field of short videos, and resolutely rectify short video platforms and unauthorized copying and performances by producers and operators of self-media and public accounts. , Spread the infringement of other people&#39;s films, music and other works. Promote short video platforms, self-media, and public account operators to fully perform their main responsibilities, effectively strengthen the construction of the copyright system, improve the copyright complaint handling mechanism, and effectively perform the obligation of reporting on illegal and criminal clues and cooperating in investigations. Encourage and support film copyright collective management organizations to strengthen their own construction, carry out collective management of film copyrights in accordance with the law, and play a good role in safeguarding the legal rights of rights holders and facilitating the legal use of users. On the one hand, we will not be merciless to infringers, and on the other hand, we will encourage excellent works. Recently, the first &quot;China Annual IP Selection&quot; aimed at telling the Chinese story, encouraging integrity and innovation, strengthening protection, promoting transformation, and mining China&#39;s good IP was announced. The selection activity is guided by the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department and hosted by the National Copyright Exchange Center Alliance. Film and television originals occupy a place among the top ten tracks set by it to find outstanding representatives of Chinese cultural copyright in various fields. &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; won the gold award, &quot;The Great Sister&quot; and &quot;Su Mang&#39;s Covenant&quot; won the silver award, &quot;Assassination of the Novelist&quot; won the bronze award, and &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; won the promotion award. Li Heng, chairman of the China National Copyright Exchange, said that under the current background that the country attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights, it is necessary to make great efforts to promote the changes in the content, market, and concepts of the cultural industry to effectively promote the inheritance, innovation and development of culture. Achieve diversity and diversified cultural transmission, promote deeper and broader cultural exchanges such as spiritual and material; and in various tracks in the cultural field, excavate outstanding local Chinese IP, protect copyright from being stolen and changed in circulation, and retain artistic and cultural characteristics , To better promote cultural and artistic exchanges and prosperity.

      "33. COVID-19 vaccination take-up rate among seniors good but more can be done, say experts. SINGAPORE: The take-up rate of COVID-19 vaccination among seniors is acceptable, or even good, but more can be done to boost numbers, infectious diseases experts said. Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said earlier this month that about 60 per cent of eligible seniors aged 70 and above have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments, while the corresponding proportion for eligible seniors aged 60 to 69 is close to 70 per cent. Infectious diseases experts said that the proportion is good, especially in comparison to the take-up rate of the influenza vaccination, which they said is the most comparable to the COVID-19 vaccination. “I think it’s an acceptable figure. If you look at the influenza vaccination, which has been promoted annually, we don’t even achieve 15 to 20 per cent, so this is actually very good,” said infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital Dr Leong Hoe Nam. When asked if the better take-up for the COVID-19 vaccination is because it is potentially fatal, he said that the flu can also be fatal, taking the lives of 200 out of every 100,000 people aged 70 and above annually in Singapore. Influenza can trigger heart attack and stroke, he explained.      READ: COVID-19 vaccination for seniors aged 70 and above begins in Singapore Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said that the take-up rate among seniors is “really good”. “Flu is also known to be fatal in elderly people. In fact, it's probably comparable fatality rate (with COVID-19), especially among the very old,” he said. However, experts said there is a need for more seniors to be vaccinated. \"We want vaccine uptake to be as high as possible,\" said Dr Hannah Clapham, Assistant Professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. There are two reasons for wanting a high level of vaccination - so that people are protected from COVID-19 and to boost population immunity.  “For the senior group, the first reason is very important as if people in this group become infected, they have a high risk of severe disease,” she said. READ: COVID-19 vaccination for people aged 60 to 69 brought forward, invitations to go out in 'next few days': MOH People should get vaccinated so that “as a whole, as a country, we can boost our population-based immunity and as a result of that, we may be able to inch towards normalcy”, said Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases physician at Rophi Clinic. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ENCOURAGE SENIORS Such health and community benefits are among the explanations Silver Generation Office (SGO) volunteer Vesuvasam Perianar gives to seniors when he goes door to door to engage them. SGO, the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care, has been engaging seniors since February this year with the help of about 3,000 volunteers. “Our main job is to ask them if they have received the letters. If they have and have not made the appointment we will ask them why they have not made the appointment,” the 66-year-old told CNA. If seniors indicate that they need help in booking a slot, Mr Perianar will help them on the spot. “In most cases, they will say ‘my children will help, but they haven’t had time, they will do it in a short while, maybe a few days later’,” he said. Others may be waiting for their next medical appointment in a month or two with their regular doctors to make sure that the vaccination is safe for them, he added. Information on their plans to register for a slot goes into a report he has to create at the end of these sessions, Mr Perianar said. Based on the report, a volunteer - not necessarily him - will then go back to the home to get an update on the status of the booking. Mr Perianar does these engagements with a partner four times a week for about two hours each time. READ: Government plans to invite people below the age of 45 to book COVID-19 vaccination slots from June SGO also arranges transport for seniors who are not able to get to a vaccination centre on their own, he said. Mr Perianar said that while the majority of the seniors he approaches would say that they would be booking an appointment, or need help doing so, about 20 per cent of them would be sceptical or distrustful of the vaccination regime. To convince seniors, he tells them that they may not be able to travel overseas, even for religious pilgrimage, without the vaccination. He also uses himself as an example of someone who has had the vaccination.  He said: “Sometimes after we speak for a while … they will be more open. They will say ‘ok lah, I’ll consider lah’.” Still, some of them are “very adverse”, calling the regime a “government gimmick” and refusing to accept a leaflet containing more information, he said. He said that some of them bring up negative news about vaccination and have fears of overdosing, or deaths that they misunderstand that have happened because of the vaccination. BARRIERS TO VACCINATION Dr Leong said individuals have different reasons for not wanting to get the vaccination. “There are many elderly people whom I have spoken to who say: ‘I’m not afraid of COVID-19. In fact if I die, so be it. I’m not afraid of dying’,” he said. Barriers to seniors getting vaccinated could include mobility, logistics and understanding of the vaccination, said Dr Ling.  “They (seniors) may at times listen to their friends more than what is on the mainstream media. Sometimes, older folks, they could have more inertia to get themselves vaccinated,” she said. Some of them may not feel the need to get the vaccination especially if community numbers are low and they don’t go out so much, she added. Dr Clarence Tam, Assistant Professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that findings from a survey he recently conducted with his team suggest that many people are taking a wait-and-see approach. “They are unsure if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks of side effects, particularly given that the risk of contracting COVID-19 is currently low,” said Dr Tam. The survey, which has not been published, was conducted online earlier this month among 1,000 Singapore residents aged 21 and above. Findings were similar among seniors and other groups, he added. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE TAKE-UP AMONG SENIORS When asked what would make them more willing to get vaccinated, respondents commonly mentioned personal recommendations from healthcare professionals, family, employers, friends and the Government, said Dr Tam. For a third of respondents, a strong motivator would be the relaxation of social distancing rules if many people are vaccinated, he added. Seeing positive stories on social media from people who had been vaccinated would also make them willing, Dr Tam said. In contrast, people would be put off vaccination if a family member had a bad reaction to the vaccine, if friends or family advised against vaccination or if they saw content on social media advising against vaccination, he said. “Positive reinforcement and prompts from a broad range of trusted sources will be needed to encourage undecided individuals to get vaccinated,” he said, adding that healthcare professionals have an important role to play, particularly in allaying worries about side effects. Dr Leong, who said that Singapore should increase the proportion of vaccinated seniors by 10 per cent, said that videos of elderly public figures getting vaccinated could help. The narrative used to convince the elderly should revolve around helping their families, he said. “It could be someone saying ‘I am a grandmother, I am 70 years old, I am getting myself vaccinated because of my grandchildren’,” he said. Another way is to regularly organise trips to vaccination centres for seniors, ferrying five seniors at a go. “What we have to do is literally take the mountain to Muhammad,” he said. However, Dr Leong said that he expects many seniors who have not been vaccinated to be immobile and that they may not account for much in overall herd immunity. “Individuals who are mobile, interacting in public areas are more important in the calculation of herd immunity. These individuals tend to be more well-informed, a bit on the younger side of 70 and they would be interacting with their peers,” he said.

      "34. First observation | These words of the general secretary are not just to say one time and one place. In the past few days, General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Guangxi and gave important instructions on the construction of ecological civilization along the way. Many golden sentences have been brushed off the screen. At almost the same time, the Central Ecological Environmental Protection Inspectorate in eight provinces and autonomous regions notified many typical cases of destroying the ecological environment. It is thought-provoking to link these two things together. On the Lijiang River, General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to a report on the comprehensive management of the river basin. In recent years, Guilin City has vigorously promoted the Lijiang River to &quot;control chaos, water, mountains, and root causes&quot; to improve the ecological environment of the Lijiang River. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Hongshe general secretary emphasized, “The worst thing is quarrying. If you destroy a mountain, you will lose such a mountain forever. The whole of China and the world is such a treasure. Don’t destroy it.” Central Ecological Environment Among the typical cases just exposed by the protection inspection team, there are several cases of illegal quarrying and mining. In some places, illegal quarrying is still carried out in the World Geopark Reserve, which has caused serious ecological damage. This time, the general secretary pointed out the quarrying problem straightforwardly, which is very realistic for some places. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, whether it is for domestic investigations and investigations or attending international events, wherever General Secretary Xi Jinping goes, he has talked about the concept that green waters and green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains. However, some phenomena that seriously damage the ecology and seriously pollute the environment are still exposed from time to time. What is the problem behind this? Some local leading cadres believe that the region has a good ecological background, large environmental capacity, a little sewage, a little tree cut, and a little project &quot;innocent&quot;, and they lack understanding of the urgency of ecological environmental protection. The concept of &quot;emphasizing development and neglecting protection&quot; of some local leading cadres has not been fundamentally reversed, and the phenomenon that ecological environmental protection is &quot;important when it comes to it, but secondary when it is done&quot; still occurs from time to time. There are also historical reasons that some local leading cadres &quot;should the pot&quot;, and the ability and level of governance to implement the new development concept still needs to be improved. &quot;Any abuse of mining and digging requires not only accountability, but also criminal responsibility in accordance with the law.&quot; Regarding the chaos of quarrying, the general secretary&#39;s words were very serious, and once again sounded the alarm for the ecological and environmental protection of various places. In fact, this is also the consistent attitude of the Party Central Committee towards ecological and environmental issues. The illegal construction of villas in Qinling Mountains destroys the ecological environment. General Secretary Xi Jinping has issued important instructions 6 times to solve the problems personally; local ecological damage in the Qilian Mountains, pollution incident in the Tengger Desert, illegal filling of the Qiandao Lake... Grasp the problem of destruction to the end. There is a phenomenon that is particularly noteworthy. In the past few days, the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team has exposed many typical cases of blindly expanding production capacity and launching projects regardless of resource endowments-Shanxi Jinzhong City has not approved the first construction and launched five large-scale coking projects in violation of regulations. Enterprises illegally discharged pollutants and competed with the people for water, causing difficulties for nearby residents. The construction of chemical and coal power projects in Guzhen County, Anhui illegally started construction, and the bottom line of regional environmental quality has been repeatedly breached, posing a threat to the water ecological environment of the Huaihe River... In the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, after experiencing the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and facing the external environment of headwinds and currents, the enthusiasm for development projects in some places began to swell, and they wanted to pursue a &quot;good start.&quot; The Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Supervisor is approved by the Party Central Committee. At the beginning of the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot;, this inspection was organized, and the strict control of high energy-consuming and high-emission projects was blindly launched as one of the inspection priorities, which was very targeted. Coincidentally, 5 years ago, the &quot;13th Five-Year Plan&quot; started. Before that, in 2015, China&#39;s economic growth continued to slow down, falling below 7%. Some provinces and cities along the Yangtze River are gearing up for projects in the 13th Five-Year Plan. On January 5, 2016, General Secretary Xi Jinping convened a symposium on promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in Chongqing, and he eloquently proposed “to protect together, and not to develop”. &quot;It seems to be a pot of cold water.&quot; This symposium promptly cooled the development impulse of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River, and it was a reversal of the direction of economic development. In the past five years, the General Secretary hosted three symposiums around the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt to consolidate the path of ecological priority and green development. Practice has proved that the joint efforts to protect the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River not only did not affect the development speed of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River, but also greatly enhanced the supporting and leading role of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in supporting the high-quality development of the country. Looking at the first year in five years, getting started is critical. The &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; is a critical period and window period for carbon peaks. Once the “two highs” project blindly launched, it will not only damage the current ecological environment, but also pose a severe challenge to the future carbon dioxide emission reduction and the achievement of carbon peak and carbon neutral commitments. It is very necessary to press down on such signs from the beginning. Combining this background, and looking at the words of the General Secretary during this Guangxi inspection, we can bring out more profound meaning-&quot;adhere to the correct ecological concept and development concept&quot;; &quot;maintain the authenticity and integrity of the landscape ecology as an important &quot;Work&quot;; &quot;Incorporate carbon peaking and carbon neutrality into the overall layout of economic and social development and ecological civilization construction&quot;; &quot;Promote a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development&quot;; &quot;Come on a path of high-quality development that conforms to local realities&quot;... This It was spoken to Guangxi, and it was spoken to the whole country. A good start, a good start. The alarm bells must be ringing forever in all places, and the trend of destroying the ecological environment in exchange for economic development at a time, insisting on ecological priority and promoting high-quality development can create a high-quality and happy life for the people.

      "47. VELCAN HOLDINGS : Annual results 2020 - stable financial results but decrease of the net income. t PRESS RELEASE Luxembourg, 30 th  April 2021 : ANNUAL RESULTS 20 20 STABLE FINANCIAL RESULTS  BUT DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA  NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var % Revenues (EUR m) 2. 5 2. 8 -12 % EBITDA (EUR m) - 2.0 -1. 4 -4 5% Net Income (EUR m) 2. 1 3 . 6 -4 1 % Shareholders’ Equity (EUR m) 1 16 1 21 -4 % Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 +1 %  closed 2020 with a net result, Group share, of EUR 2.1m compared to EUR 3.6m in 2019. This decline essentially stems from, on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects, leading to an overall decline of the result. The EBITDA is also down by 45% ( EUR -2.0m in 2020 vs EUR -1.4 m in 2019). Net financial gains, which amounted to EUR 7.7m , were almost stable compared to EUR 8.1m in 2019, mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities. Shareholder’s equity decreased by 4% mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 (492 k shares bought back in 2020, for a total price of EUR 3.1m ). During 2020, the  continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India (571 MW), and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant (15 MW) in Brazil . The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained, as in 2019, and prevented progress of the projects, leading to an additional provision or Eur 2.8 million (20%) for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects. This brought the total provision to Eur 7.1 million (50%), considering the previously booked provisions. This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 . The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low, 40% below the 2019 generation, as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 . At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown (+18%) thanks to the inflation of selling prices. In Euro the turnover is down by 12% ( EUR 2.5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2.8 m in 2019) because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 (-41%). FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 – MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress, due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments, aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Techno-Economic Clearance (TEC), Environmental Clearance, Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo-Tato-1 (426 MW), the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition, the transport infrastructure, the amendment of the concession agreements, the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments. During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land, complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations. The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak, as the required meetings could happen only physically. The procedure could restart only in February 2021 . All the on-site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the  in March 2021 , without interruption. As of the date of this press release, the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the . However the Group’s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the  as being under ownership dispute, and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government. The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh (GoAP) will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects’ implementation. considers that, as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations, the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government. The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer. Negotiations with the GoAP, for the amendment of the concession agreement, relate to the development timeframe, but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities (still 380MW in the current concession agreement) and other important terms, have not progressed since 2018. This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato-1 (426 MW) tandem in 2020, as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA, or a non-objection certificate (NOC) from the GoAP. TECs of Heo and Tato-1 HEP, granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years, were bearing validities until on 27 th  July 2020 and 28 th  October 2020 respectively. Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA, which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a (NOC) acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW. After several discussions the GoAP refused, on 1 st  October 2020 , to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs, some of which the Group does not agree with. After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020, without success, the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021. Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities, the administrative fees, the development timeframe, the obligations of both parties, and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects. The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market. As of the date of this press release, the discussions are going on with the GoAP, but both TECs of Heo and Tato-1 HEP are technically not valid anymore, and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement (in addition to the CEA renewal procedure). The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years. No progress has been made by the  regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule. The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022, but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed. On the forest clearance side, the renewal of the stage-I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date. The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020. All the major Indian power traders (PPA brokers) and distribution companies (DISCOMS) contacted for Heo and Tato-1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond. The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions, which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower. The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs, the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies (DISCOMS) and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power. Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run-of-the-River (ROR, hence with no storage) hydro projects such as Heo and Tato-1 HEPs. Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the , a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued, imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation (HPO) on DISCOMS, setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030. These percentages range from 0.18% to 2.82% and are remarkably lower than those of solar power, currently at 10.25% for 2021. The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction. Despite the above issues, the Group’s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor. They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno-economic and environmental features. Despite long term promising prospects, the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties. The Groups’ projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row. These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2.8 million (20% of gross value) decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects. This brought the total provision to Eur 7.1 million (50% of gross value), considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years ( EUR 4.4m or 30% of gross value). The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I.4.1 of the annual report available at . Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant (15 MW) recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020, 40% below the 2019 generation (49 113 MWh in 2019) and close to its all-time record low of 2012 (24 793 MWh). However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency (BRL) was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system. But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020, the plant had to compensate the MRE system, which was in a negative position. This is why payments to the MRE were much higher, reaching EUR 0.7m in 2020 vs. EUR 0.2m in 2019. As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8.1m against BRL 9.3m in 2019, down by 13%. When converted in euro, the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1.4m vs 2.1m in 2019 (-51%) mostly due to a 34% depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020. Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets. The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes. The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60% in bonds, mostly high yield corporate ones. This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February, as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks. Since the March 2020 market crunch, the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities (mostly gold). As of 31 st  December 2020 , the bonds exposure, including T-bills, was reduced to 19% of the portfolio (64% as of 31/12/19), whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash, financial assets and financial liabilities ( EUR 104.5 m) included:  a negative net cash position of EUR 9.3 m (-9% of the portfolio) versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27.2 m in 2019 (25% of the portfolio), 19% of gold related exposure (versus 1% as of 31/12/2019), 21% of oil related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 4% of silver related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 42% of equity (excluding oil) long positions (7% as of 31/12/2019), 4% of equity short positions (2% in 2019), 1% in private equity and credit (3% in 2019).  While reallocating its financial assets towards equity, the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid-19 situation. The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy. This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7.7 m as of 31/12/2020, stable when compared to 2019 (EUR 8.1 m) and despite the COVID-19 crisis. Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets ( USA , Europe and Japan ), the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term. The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen. As of 31/12/2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars (35% against 67% in 2019), the Japanese Yen (25% against 2% in 2019) and the Euro (22% against 9% in 2019). It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure. Contrary to the previous years, the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage (see above / net cash position) The financial portfolio is detailed in part I, section 3.1.B of the annual report 2020 available at . During the year  continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares. The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares. A total of 492,348 shares were bought back in 2020, for a total price of Eur 3,131,696 . 275,000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and, as of 31 st  December 2020 ,  held 314,023 own shares representing 5.66% of its share capital. Foreseeable evolution of the Group: After the closing of this financial year, the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021:  Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects. On the short term, executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects, in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances. Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments;   The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid-19 crisis, which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio. FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 – MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement (unaudited consolidated) Turnover amounted to EUR 2.5m (against EUR 2.8m in 2018, a 12% decrease), mainly from electricity sales in Brazil . The turnover in local currency increased by 18% with the inflation on electricity sale prices. However, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency vs the Euro currency was responsible for a 34% decrease of the turnover in Euro. The current operating result amounted to EUR -5.6m (against -4.3m in 2019):  Payments to the MRE (Energy Reallocation Mechanism) were EUR 0.7m in 2020 vs. EUR 0.2m in 2019. Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0.5m ( EUR 0.7m in 2019), while depreciation on intangible projects under development was EUR 2.8 vs an amount of EUR 2.2m in 2019, due to the provision passed on Indian projects. Staff expenses amounted to EUR 2.7m in 2020 vs EUR 2.6m in 2019. The Group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020. External expenses are totaling EUR 1.4m in 2020 vs EUR 1.5m in 2019.  Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7.7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation (-9% compared to end of 2019) and its impact on the Group’s cash and financial assets position. The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group, avoiding bigger potential forex losses (see breakdown per currency in chapter I.7.4. of the annual report). This gain of 7.7m compares to EUR 8.1m in 2019. In 2020, other operating income ( EUR 0.2m ) consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years. This figure was NIL in 2019. Income tax expense amounted to EUR -0.2m in 2020, same as in 2019. The net result, Group share, was EUR 2.1m in 2020 FY compared to EUR 3.6m in 2019. The Group’s EBITDA reached EUR -2.0m compared to EUR -1.4m in 2019. The strong depreciation of BRL (-41%) and INR (Indian Currency -12%) closing rates when compared to Euro, at 2020 closing date, has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income, as the Group’s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency ( EUR -4.5m in 2020 against EUR -0.1m in 2019). The total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of EUR -2.4m in 2020 against a gain of EUR 3.5m in 2019. Balance sheet  –  Assets (unaudited consolidated) Net intangible assets stands at 8.3m in 2020 and are down by EUR 3.7m versus 2019, mostly because of the provision of EUR -2.8m of Indian assets, the depreciation of the Indian currency ( EUR -0.9m ) and the Brazilian currency ( EUR -0.5m ) despite the addition of EUR 0.7m of capitalized costs on Indian projects. Net tangible assets stands at 5.3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2.7m between 2019 and 2020, mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant ( EUR -0.5m ) and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency ( EUR -2.3m ). Cash, cash equivalent assets and financial assets (net of Current financial liabilities) have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 (+1%) mainly thanks the good performance of the Group’s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs. Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity, bonds and commodities related stocks. Finally total assets increased by 15.3% during 2020 FY (up by EUR 18.9 m), mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the “liabilities” and the related asset purchases. At 31 st  December 2020 , the Group ( and its subsidiaries) holds 314,023 own shares (2019: 146,810). At year end closing price of EUR 6.41 those own shares have a market value of EUR 2.0m . Balance sheet –  Liabilities (unaudited consolidated) Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities amount to EUR 0.7m and EUR 1.0m at 31 December 2020 respectively and arise from litigations related to the 2 biomass plants previously owned by the Group (Satyamaharshi SMPCL – 7.5 MW and Rithwik RPPL – 7.5 MW, owned between 2006 and 2010). The existing provision represents the major part of the claims as well as accumulated interests and judicial expenses. Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0.9 m vs EUR 0.5m in 2019 (due to EUR 0.3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil , due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation). Current financial liabilities of EUR 23.9 m in 2020 (vs NIL in 2019) are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities. Under this facility, securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money. This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits. But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices. Own shares, booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost, reduce the net shareholder’s equity of the Group by EUR -2.1m at 31 st  December 2020 versus EUR -1.2m at 31 st  December 2019 following the share buyback programs ( EUR -3.1m ), the capital reduction ( EUR +1.9m ) and the use of shares to cover share based payments ( EUR +0.4m ). As at 31 st  December 2020 , unrealized losses on conversion reserves, booked directly against the equity amounted to EUR -14.2m versus an unrealized loss of EUR -9.6m at 31 st  December 2019 , as the BRL and INR currencies heavily depreciated VS EUR currency in 2020.

      "49. New Apple TV 4K, iPad Pro to launch on May 21. San Francisco:  After a successful “Spring Loaded” event, Apple is likely to launch the new iPad Pro with M1 and the upgraded Apple TV 4K with revamped Siri Remote on May 21. Known tipster Jon Prosser updated in a tweet that Apple will also launch the new Apple TV on May 21 along with iPad Pro. The launch date arrives as information from UK retailer John Lewis revealed availability for the new iMac and iPad Pro on May 21, which is when the new Apple 4K TV will also be launched by the Cupertino-based giant. Previously, Prosser believed that the 11-inch model would arrive a day after on May 22, but now the tipster claims that both models would launch on the same date. Recently, Apple has announced its most powerful and advanced iPad Pro ever, featuring an M1 chip, ultra-fast 5G and a stunning 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display. The new 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be available in silver and space grey finishes. iPad Pro is available in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB configurations. The company also unveiled a new iMac that features a 24-inch 4.5K Retina display with 11.3 million pixels, 500 nits of brightness and over a billion colours, delivering a brilliant and vivid viewing experience.\n",

      "50. Ransomware explained: No silver bullet, crooks out of reach. BOSTON: Political hand-wringing in Washington over Russia’s hacking of federal agencies and interference in US politics has mostly overshadowed a worsening digital scourge with a far broader wallop: crippling and dispiriting extortionary ransomware attacks by cybercriminal mafias that mostly operate in foreign safe havens out of the reach of Western law enforcement.Stricken in the United States alone last year were more than 100 federal, state and municipal agencies, upwards of 500 health care centers, 1,680 educational institutions and untold thousands of businesses, according to the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Dollar losses are in the tens of billions. Accurate numbers are elusive. Many victims shun reporting, fearing the reputational blight.All the while, ransomware gangsters have become more brazen and cocky as they put more and more lives and livelihoods at risk. This week, one syndicate threatened to make available to local criminal gangs data they say they stole from the Washington, D.C., metro police on informants. Another recently offered to share data purloined from corporate victims with Wall Street inside traders. Cybercriminals have even reached out directly to people whose personal info was harvested from third parties to pressure victims to pay up.“In general, the ransomware actors have gotten more bold and more ruthless,” said Allan Liska, an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On April 29, a public-private task force including Microsoft, Amazon, the National Governors Association, the FBI, Secret Service and Britain and Canada’s elite crime agencies delivered to the White House an 81-page urgent action plan for an aggressive and comprehensive whole-of-government assault on ransomware.At the report’s online launch, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a pre-recorded video that the White House is developing a plan for disrupting ransomware and his department “will work to implement many of (the panel’s) recommendations, because one thing is clear: Ransomware is a threat to our national security.”Mayorkas last month announced a DHS ransomware initiative, and the Department of Justice has just created a task force to tackle the scourge.Where did ransomware come from? How does it work?The criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly Russian-speaking and operate with near impunity out of Russia and allied countries. They are a continuation and refinement - ransomware was barely a blip three years ago - of more than two decades of cyber-thieving that spammed, stole credit cards and identities and emptied bank accounts. The syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill, leveraging dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with tools like the Tor browser and cryptocurrencies that make payments - and their laundering - harder to track.Ransomware scrambles a victim organisation’s data with encryption. The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and, once paid, provide software decryption keys.Last year, ransomware crooks expanded into data-theft blackmail. Before triggering encryption, they quietly exfiltrate sensitive files and threaten to expose them publicly unless ransoms are paid. Victims who diligently backed up their networks as a hedge against ransomware now had to think twice about refusing to pay. At the end of 2019, only one ransomware group had an extortion site online that would publish such files. Now more than two dozen do.Victims who refuse to pay can incur costs that far exceed the ransoms they might have negotiated. It happened recently to the University of Vermont Health Network. It suffered an estimated US$1.5mil a day in losses in the two months it took to recover. More than 5,000 hospital computers, their data scrambled into gibberish, had to be wiped clean and reconstituted from backed-up data.The University of California-San Francisco, heavily involved in Covid-19 research, barely hesitated before paying. It gave the criminals US$1.1mil last June. Manufacturers have been especially hard-hit this year, with ransoms of US$50mil demanded of computer makers Acer and Quanta, a major supplier of Apple laptops.How are these criminals organised?Some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals. They take pride in their “customer service”, providing “help desks” that assist paying victims in file decryption. And they tend to keep their word. They have brands to protect, after all.“If they stick to their promises, future victims will be encouraged to pay up,” Maurits Lucas, director of intelligence solutions at the cybersecurity firm Intel471, told a webinar earlier this year. “As a victim you actually know their reputation.”The business tends to be compartmentalised. An affiliate will identify, map out and infect targets, choose victims and deploy ransomware that is typically “rented” from a ransomware-as-a-service provider. The provider gets a cut of the payout, the affiliate normally taking more than three-quarters. Other subcontractors may also get a slice. That can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running the so-called “bulletproof domains” behind which the ransomware gangs hide their “command-and-control” servers. Those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation, a stealthy process that can take weeks.Why do ransoms keep climbing? How can they be stopped?In Thursday’s report, the task force says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments, largely because “ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack”.The task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy. Worse, the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim’s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit. They’ve been known to mention it in negotiations.That degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than US$310,000 last year, up 171% from 2019, according to Palo Alto Networks, a task force member.Not surprisingly, the still-young cyber-insurance industry is reeling. Premiums have gone up by 50% to 100% in the past year as ransomware became the No. 1 claim, said Michael Phillips, chief claims officer of Resilience Insurance and a co-chair of the task force. On average, cyber-insurance claim payouts can now exceed 70% of what is paid in premiums - prompting some insurers to drop this type of insurance altogether, industry reports show.The multi-pronged response to ransomware proposed by the task force will require the kind of concerted diplomatic, legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies that the Trump administration shunned, displacing what the authors call the current “uncoordinated, disjointed” response.“There is no silver bullet, but if we’re going to shift the trajectory of this type of attack the US government has got to get at this with some speed,” said task force co-chair Philip Reiner, CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology.Ransomware developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed (they are not always easy to identify) and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions, the report urges.It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal “response fund” to provide financial assistance to victims - in hopes that, in many cases, it will prevent them from paying ransoms. And it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware proceeds.The task force also calls for something potentially controversial: amending the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to let private industry actively block or limit online criminal activity, including of botnets, the networks of hijacked zombie computers that ransomware criminals use to sow infections.The odds of successfully stifling ransomware are high, the report’s authors acknowledge: “The old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once, while a defender has to be lucky every minute of every day, has never been more true.”- AP\n",

      "55. Super Soco’s CPx ‘super-scooter’: Going electric for a germ-free commute. Sales of electric motorcycles are big news for the bike industry; latest figures show that March registrations in this sector this year are up by 151 per cent over the same month in 2020, while nearly half of all new low-powered scooters are now battery powered. Could it be because commuters, post-Covid, are fearful of rubbing shoulders with strangers on public transport, because it’s easier to filter past  caused by the spread of ‘emergency’ LTNs, or because they’re fun, relatively inexpensive to run and  friendly? It’s probably a mix of all three, but to find what all the fuss is about, I jumped on one of the latest new machines, the CPx ‘super-scooter’ from Super Soco, who claim it’s similar in performance to a 125cc two-wheeler. Attractively styled, the CPx comes either with one battery, offering a claimed range of 44 miles, or two, offering a claimed range of 87 miles. The price difference between the two is significant, with the single-battery model costing £3,599 (after taking the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles grant into consideration) and the dual-battery model costing £4,699, demonstrating just how pricey battery technology still is. The CPx comes in black, grey or silver, and is backed by a two-year warranty for the vehicle, three for the battery. It can be ridden on an A1 licence (requiring training, after which, if you pass the various test levels, you will be entitled to carry a pillion and ride on the motorway, although I wouldn’t recommend that on the CPx with its limited top speed). The Super Soco is reasonably well equipped, with a smart, clear LCD display, reasonably good build quality, a big, comfy (thought slightly too high) squashy seat, a tall, clear, protective screen, very decent rear-view mirrors, a useful parcel rack, a side stand as well as centre stand, and even a reverse mode (useful, perhaps, for getting out of tight front-garden parking spaces). It is - of course - eerily quiet once you turn the key, and all it requires to get moving (there’s no clutch or gears) is a twist of the throttle, which sees the bike spring to life and surge forward thanks to its 4.8Kw (5hp) hub-mounted electric motor. In London traffic it kept up nicely with other vehicles from a standing start; in fact its forte is leaping smartly away from traffic lights. Acceleration is reasonably swift and progressive (at least when the batteries are well-charged; during our brief assessment they didn’t drop below 80 per cent), right up to the claimed top speed of around 55mph. The brakes (both operated by hand controls as with a bicycle) worked firmly and effectively, and the steering was sufficiently ‘quick’ to make filtering around other traffic very efficient indeed. It also felt grippy on the road in bends, despite having fairly narrow tyres, although we didn’t ride it in the wet. Compared to the more basic model launched by Super Soco and reviewed here in 2017, the CPx is far more advanced. Thanks to the 16-inch front wheel the CPx felt stable and well able to cope with lumps and bumps in the road - at least at the front end. At the rear, where there’s a smaller 14-inch rear wheel, the CPx’s ability to soak up bumps was more limited; you need to slow down for sharper-edged ramps to avoid a jolt through the seat. The CPx was very easy to push into and out of parking spaces (important in London), stable when parked on its side-stand and easy to hoist onto its equally-stable centre stand. Despite its rakish looks there’s not much in the way of luxury - it’s a scooter after all - but there’s a small hidey-hole (large enough for a phone though I wouldn’t advise it, it might bounce out) in the leg shields, next to a hook (useful perhaps for carrying take-aways or small shopping bags). There’s also a USB socket for charging purposes, a built-in alarm, decent-sized pillion foot pegs and an ‘ignition’ operated steering lock. The batteries live under the hinged seat and can be charged from a standard household plug in situ, or easily detached and carried indoors to be plugged in. They are heavy, mind, at nearly 20kgs each. You wouldn’t want to carry them far. Likes? The CPx is a cinch to ride, very quiet, and (unless you count the fumes going up the electric power station chimney) very ‘clean’. It’s also stable and (vicious speed bumps aside) comfy. Dislikes? The otherwise effective screen felt perilously close to my face; I’d prefer it to have been angled further away, for safety. The seat is high and broad on account of the size of the batteries, so will put shorter riders off. I would also have preferred more built-in stowage, but there really isn’t room. If it was mine, I’d invest in a small top box, fitted to the rack. So who’s going to buy it? You could find a new petrol-powered scooter for less but that, of course, would cause more pollution and wouldn’t give you the same, electric, environmental feel-good factor while  through London. It will appeal to those who like the easy, unintimidating, approachable nature of an electric scooter, and to those for whom environmental issues are paramount. Crucially it is also - according to figures supplied by Super Soco - considerably cheaper to run than a petrol model. It’s worth noting, however, that according to motorcycle ‘bible’ MCN, which conducted extensive tests, performance on the CPx can drop off as the batteries’ charge level goes down. They also said they were able to achieve an 80-mile range with two batteries; but only by remaining under 30mph; no problem in London. Super Soco’s own sums show that an average 125cc petrol scooter costs 5p per mile to run, compared to just 1p for the CPx. Over a year, for a typical 23-mile, round commute, over 256 working days a year, that amounts to a cost of £294.40 for a petrol scooter, or a winning £58.88 for the CPx. There’s the added convenience of not having to stop at petrol stations. Charging the batteries, instead, they say, takes 3-4 hours and can be done at home or the office. A petrol scooter costs £25 a year to tax, while the keeper of an electric scooter pays nothing. Maintenance is also far less of an issue for electric bikes, as there are fewer moving parts. If the CPx’s battery should ever need replacing outside warranty, however, it’s hardly cheap, at over £1,800. So there you have it - a clean, quiet, guilt-free new-tech solution to commuting around London post-Covid, while avoiding all those potentially germy commuters on the bus and tube.

      "62. Don’t take the p*** out of Tony Blair’s mullet – he doesn’t look like Pat Sharp, I fancy him more than ever… it’s sexy. FORMER PM Tony Blair sported a silvery mullet on telly - and viewers were left in stitches, comparing him to children’s TV presenter Pat Sharp and late club owner Peter Stringfellow.  The ex-Labour leader, 67, was making a serious point on ITV about Scottish independence — but online wags were more interested in his hair. 5 Blair stunned viewers with his locks  The ex-Labour boss, who left office in 2007 and handed over to Gordon Brown, showed off his long grey do during an interview - leading to one person quipping “It’s not Tony Blair, it’s Tony Hair.” Another said: “I think Pat Sharp has some serious competition.” But one woman who was left swooning after spotting the ex-PM’s swishy locks was mum-of-two and writer Hannah Verdier, 48, from south London.“He looked hot,” she says. Now Hannah explains exactly why she fancies 'Tone'... 5 Hannah has confessed how much she fancies Blair Credit: Supplied  AS soon as I saw Tony Blair on ITV earlier this week my heart skipped a beat. No, not because of what he was saying (to be honest I wasn’t really paying attention) but because of his hair.  Other people might have been taking the p*** out of his silvery grey mullet which resembled Pat Sharp’s locks, but I was utterly charmed. He looks fantastic, like a man in his prime. Cherie - you’ve got a love rival. Hair haters are gonna hate, but at 67 the Labour legend can still get away with the kind of hairdo Harry Styles would be proud of.  5 Tony during his number 10 heyday Credit: Times Newspapers Ltd  His new barnet is a style statement, not the result of shirking a long-awaited visit to the barber’s and it’s one that makes him look hotter than ever. Back in the early noughties, Tony turned heads when he and his rippling beach bod were named Heat magazine’s Torso of the Week, a prestigious accolade usually reserved for the likes of Daniel Craig.  But he’d already turned my head. He was the Rishi Sunak of his day, with hotness and power oozing from every pore.  You knew you were in safe hands with Tone, in more ways than one. As a trembling young reporter I once sat next to him on the Downing Street sofa while I gave him a grilling for a teen magazine and it’s only now that I can finally come out and tell the truth: he was hot - and his greying locks which have been cruelly compared to the late Peter Stringfellow’s just make him hotter. He looks fantastic, like a man in his prime.  Cherie - you’ve got a love rival. Hannah Verdier 48  Tony was always perfectly dressed and in control, he had Noel Gallagher on speed dial and you just knew that he and Cherie weren’t afraid to rumple their John Lewis quilt cover.  The fact that Andrew Scott - who played the Hot Priest in Fleabag -  is lined up to play him in The Crown is perfect casting.  Strong and sexy, both are men who’d hold your gaze for a second too long. In a good way. If reports and memoirs are to be believed, Tony and Cherie enjoy a marriage packed with hot lovin’, but if by any chance he was ever on Tinder there would be no shortage of right swipes for the silver fox.  His hair is evolving into something that will help him stay sexy into his 70s, a la Mick Jagger or Jeff Bridges.  5 People compared Blair's locks to the late Peter Stringfellow's Credit:  - Getty  Technically, it’s not even a mullet because it’s not short on top – it’s just flowing.  And come the summer, he can even rock a headband or man bun. It’s been a lean year for fun and all we’ve had to rely on for eye candy at teatime is Government briefings.  Would you rather enjoy a heated political debate with Matt Hancock, who at 42, is 25 years Tony’s junior but would never take a risk with his boring follicles?  Blair came to power in his 40s and maybe it was the Spice Girls soundtrack, the joy of Euro ‘96 or the air of optimism, but he looked a lot younger and hotter than today’s starched rabble.  You just knew that he and Cherie weren’t afraid to rumple their John Lewis quilt cover. Hannah Verdier 48  So it’s only right that he now embraces the grey and lets his hair flow. I bet Cherie loves it! This is the hair of a man who still has the ability to surprise his woman after all these years. The kind of hairdo that keeps calm in interviews but then is ready to party the moment it spins around. You don’t need an opinion poll to tell you the bare facts: the more a man pays attention to his style, the hotter he’s going to be in bed.  Talking of which, it’s a funny old week when the hair choices of one politician can eclipse another’s attempt to get other people to pay for his new curtains, but here we are. Blair has taken the art of the silver fox to the next level. 5 Watch out Cherie - Hannah's in town Credit: Splash News  Live Blog RAGING PRINCE Meghan's 'beyond the pale attack on Kate Middleton was William's final straw' MYSTIC MEG April 30: Your gift is juggling all the different aspects of yourself HILL WE GO Edinburgh couple trek 30km and 40k steps conquering seven hills TikTok challenge LONG LAST LOVE I'm 27 & never been kissed or slept with someone - I’ve never come close grubs up Scots hotel launch 29-minute breakfast challenge with HUGE plate of food OPEN MINDED Meet other stars who shun monogamy as Willow Smith comes out as ‘polyamorous’ Meanwhile this Line of Duty fan confessed she was hot for Supt.

      "88. [Continue to write more stories about spring and enter the new national-level special economic zone] Haikou Yaocheng’s old appearance has changed, and rural revitalization has entered the fast lane. China Net, April 29 (Reporter Tong Mingyue) A half-hour drive from Haikou City to Yanfeng Town, where there is a modern &quot;Xanadu&quot; called Yaocheng. Yaocheng Hand-painted Guide Map Photo by Tong Mingyue on China Net. The ancient village of Yaocheng is one of the famous historical and cultural villages in Haikou, with a strong cultural gene. Walking here, surrounded by greenery, beautiful scenery, coupled with a modern urban atmosphere, it is like an idyllic urban scene. Once, this was a wasteland, but now the old village has a new look. On the basis of preserving the original rural appearance, restore the architectural style of Qiongbei residential houses with &quot;swallowtail dragon ridge, golden mountain silver bow, gray wall and blue tile&quot;, and reshape a brand-new modern beautiful home through artistic design. Comparison of the transformation of the three cups of tea yards in Yaocheng. Photo by Tong Mingyue on China Net. Yaocheng’s strategic planning is guided by party building, through the co-construction and co-governance and sharing of &quot;government infrastructure, state-owned enterprise industrial investment, rural resource sharing, and farmers’ dividend guarantee&quot; The new model of beautiful village construction will build Yaocheng into a beautiful homeland with orderly ecology, harmonious integration of fields and courtyards, and interdependence between enterprises and people, and promote the highland of cultural and creative brand building in Jiangdong New District, Hainan. Let high-quality life go from the city to the countryside. Bring high-end lifestyles into the countryside, so that people in the countryside can also experience the exquisite life of the city. At the same time, the return of resources allows agricultural products from the countryside to enter the city. Promote development with industry and promote the economic layout of Jiangdong New Area. Chen Tong, the mayor of Yanfeng Town, said: &quot;Prosperous industry, livable ecology, civilized rural style, effective governance, and affluent life are our overall goals.&quot; Steadily and steadily, adapt to local conditions, create a joint development of industry, talents, and culture, and jointly revitalize Unique advantages. The interior view of the homestay was taken by Tong Mingyue on China Net to teach him how to fish. It is better to teach him how to fish. When Yaocheng was first built, the goal was &quot;Party building to lead and rural revitalization&quot;, but how to implement party building work to the end is how to get the people to accept, recognize, and support the biggest problem. Wu Panlong, Chairman and Secretary of the Party Committee of Hainan Haikong Beautiful Country Construction Co., Ltd. said: &quot;In the process of the early demolition, dealing with the people really has to sink down, squat in the fields, and communicate with the people heart and heart. &quot;Promote the development of the villagers. How to benefit the people in rural construction requires not only the government&#39;s macro-control, but also the methods and methods used by enterprises to implement them. First of all, letting the common people have a guaranteed income is a key element, and the village collective &quot;rent + dividend&quot; model is adopted. At the same time, let the ordinary people participate effectively, provide corresponding re-employment opportunities and positions, and encourage local farmers to actively participate in the construction of the project, forming a benign and sustainable industrial chain. Taking advantage of the construction of Hainan Free Trade Port and seizing the opportunity of the times when both opportunities and challenges coexist, Yaocheng will act as a good Hainan based on the general requirements of rural revitalization of &quot;prosperous industry, livable ecology, civilized rural style, effective governance, and affluent life&quot;. The free trade port is a &quot;vanguard&quot; of rural revitalization. Green water and green mountains are Jinshan Yinshan. Yaocheng is an excellent experimental field on the road of rural transformation. It seizes opportunities in the development, finds its own position, uses its unique advantages to gain momentum, and explores its own pace of development on the road of rural revitalization.\n",

It was on track to post a monthly gain as well.\"Palladium is in a structural deficit since 10 years. We have seen above ground inventories falling to very low levels, and now the price gives a signal to investors still holding it,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.\"The commodity ... comes with very low trading volume so it can be very illiquid and this is making the moves even more crazy. This rally can continue, particularly if car sales start to improve going forward.\"Demand from the auto industry is rising and expected to climb further as a semiconductor chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production eases later this year. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch said prices are unlikely to see a sustained run above $3,000, with substitution likely to bring prices down as the year goes on.\"At this level more and more car manufacturers will think about substitution (of palladium for platinum).\"A shift to electric vehicles may also eventually erode palladium demand, although tightening environmental rules have forced carmakers to use more and more palladium in their gasoline engines in recent years. spot gold XAU= was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT.

      "94. Great Green Wall promises better lives to African farmers. By Richard Wetaya Once complete, it will reportedly be the largest living structure on the planet, covering an area 8,000 km long by 17 km wide – three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef – and stretching across the entire continent. With the fresh infusion of funds – obtained at the Paris-One Planet Summit for Biodiversity – it is anticipated that hard-pressed pastoral and agricultural communities long challenged by poverty and persistent food insecurity in the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions will enjoy better lives. Diarra Fatoumata, a 38-year-old mother of four, is from one of those farming communities – Koremairwa village in the Doutchi District of southwestern Niger. She is one of many smallholder farmers who recently received improved millet and maize seeds, courtesy of the initiative. “My farming prospects have gotten better on account of using improved grain seeds,” she said recently. She elaborated: “Previously, some of the seeds I used to plant would germinate but the crops would wither and die off. With the new seeds, I am now able to produce and harvest sturdier crops, which have a better market value. “Together with other smallholder farmers from my village and other areas of the Sahel, we have also attained training on appropriate crop rotation and how to use small-scale irrigation for crop production and for extending farming activities into the dry season.” For good measure, a number of smallholder farmers in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti were also trained in proper agroforestry, water harvesting and irrigation practices and on how to create shelterbelts for their farmlands. “Shelterbelts are now helping many farmers in controlling soil erosion in Sudan,” said Abdel Aldai, a wheat and maize farmer in Karima, Sudan. He added: “With agroforestry, we were taught how to integrate trees, which are helpful in climate change mitigation, into our farming activities, with an aim of achieving better productivity by tapping into the ecosystem amenities supplied by trees.” Agricultural and environment policy analysts reckon that the additional funding vouchsafed by the French government, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Commission and other sources will breathe new life into the initiative. The initiative has just under a decade to achieve its goals of creating 10 million green jobs, sequestering 250 million tonnes of carbon, restoring 100 million hectares of degraded land and protecting Africa’s biodiversity, while reducing poverty and food insecurity. Its mediocre progress to date was highlighted in a United Nations status report, Great Green Wall: Implementation Status and Way Ahead to 2030, released last year. The report found that the though the initiative was more than halfway to its 2030 completion date, it had only covered 4 per cent of its target area. The findings did make for good reading in some African ecological and environmental research think tank circles. “For some, it was an indictment on the people in charge of the initiative,” said Faustin Banjoko, a climate action and development policy expert. He added: “It also lent credence to schools of thought that held that zero net degradation and dryland tree planting (afforestation) in the 7 million square kilometers Sahel region would face long odds, as had been the case with the North African Green Dam project.” By all accounts, however, the initiative’s execution shortfalls were due to deficiencies in funding and technical support. Now those obstacles seem to be out of the way. Godfrey Oluka, an environment specialist at the United Nations Development Programme, said the new funding – in a year, that marks the beginning of the UN’s Decade for Ecosystem Restoration – may just be the silver lining the initiative needed. “It is a welcome development. It will hopefully draw forth a renewed urgency in executing the initiative’s targets – that is, the restoration of degraded land in the Sahel, a region that experiences a 3 per cent decline in agricultural production, per year, due to land degradation. The region has in the last 30 years been devastated by severe drought and massive loss of fertile land, due to climate change and over-farming, and the enhancement of agricultural production systems in the rest of the Great Green Wall (GGW) intervention zones, represented by Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mauritania and Djibouti,” Oluka said. Banjoko elaborated: “On the face of it, there is a lot of progress being made in the GGW nations especially in the areas of promoting agroforestry, improving livestock breeding, providing green jobs, creating shelter belts for farmlands, improving irrigation efficiency for agricultural production, strengthening climate resilience and boosting pastoral and agro-pastoral regenerative agricultural production. “These will, in the course of time, all translate into better incomes and a better food security status quo.” Because crop production in the Sahel is for the most part rain-fed with limited irrigated agriculture, several smallholding traditional agriculture farmers in countries like Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali have been getting apprenticeships on the improved use of sprinkle and drip surface irrigation techniques and on proper rainwater harvesting practices. There was further good news for farmers when the Green Climate Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development recently announced that they had a pipeline investment project called the Great Green Wall Umbrella Programme (GGW Up). It would ostensibly boost climate finance for the GGW nation’s rural populations and would ensure that small-scale farmers and agribusinesses have better access to markets and strengthened value chains, creating economic opportunities and jobs, through the development of climate-resilient infrastructure and expanding the use of solar energy. Speaking at the One Planet Summit, Susan Gardner, director of the UN’s Environment Programme’s Ecosystems Division, said the initiative was an inspiring example of ecosystem restoration in action. “This initiative alone will not transform the Sahel’s fortunes overnight but will rapidly become a green growth corridor that will bring investment, boost food security, create jobs and sow the seeds of peace,” she noted. In recent years, however, there have been growing concerns that the ongoing conflict in central Sahel would slow down progress, particularly in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. There are already grim realities on the ground with statistics from the International Organisation for Migration’s Displacement Tracking Matrix indicating that over 1.5 million people have been internally displaced by the ongoing crises in the three nations. Notwithstanding that, there are pointers to strides being made. During a recent International Forest Day Forward Thinkers Webinar, Louise Baker, managing director of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification Global Mechanism, said about 20 per cent of the project’s target area has now been completed. “All partners are working assiduously towards the initiative’s 2030 targets,” she said, adding: “Eighteen million hectares of the proposed 100 million land hectares have been restored, 350,000 green jobs out of the proposed 10 million have been created and about US$90 million generated by communities in the initiative’s intervention zone.” On the green economy front, the anticipation is that by the initiative’s completion point, 8,000 kilometers of the intervention zone’s land area will be covered with a mosaic of trees and plants. Thus far, more than 5 million hectares of degraded land have been restored in Niger and 12 million trees planted in Senegal. Some 15 million land hectares have been restored in Ethiopia; 29,602 hectares in Burkina Faso; 52,930 hectares in Eritrea, and 120 hectares of land in Mali, among other places. According to the UN report, land restoration in the project intervention zones positively impacted 15 of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By all accounts, the US$90 million generated helped to reduce rural poverty in the intervention zones. Baker is upbeat about the initiative’s prospects. “This initiative will not come up short like previous tree planting ecological projects on the continent. The difference is that it is owned and implemented by communities and countries themselves,” she said. She added: “Each country has designated a protected area dedicated to activities along the Great Green Wall, managed by their local communities. “A unique practice known as rainwater harvesting which collects the heavy annual rainfall and distributes it through irrigation systems, is one of the ways in which the Great Green Wall is sustained. Sustainability of this programme is already being owned by the communities.”\n",

      "95. Shi Jinyuan: Gold and Silver Soaring and Falling Markets and Latest Price Trend Operation Suggestions. Market trend analysis: April 30, gold news analysis: Thursday (4.29) gold technical: today&#39;s gold market is after the Asian market rushed higher and the entire European market fell, so the current market day is considered to belong Weak, but from the perspective of the trend, yesterday&#39;s price broke the high point of the rebound before the last decline in 1785, and there are signs of strengthening on the trend. But the key support is the 1762 position. If this position falls below, then the whole trend will reverse and become a very weak movement. However, regardless of the trend, in the case of intraday weakening, because the US is a rebound before the market, then the US The probability of a second dip after the market is relatively high. If the US market drops twice and breaks the current low, then it is a continuation of the short position. Today&#39;s US market operation is to consider rebounding and shorting. The current pressure on the top of gold is 1779-1781-1783, which are 382-0.5-618 after the intraday high of 1798 fell, and the high point of rebound after the first fall below 1780 in the European market is near 1782. , And the support below is the 1766 position, which is the starting point for the ascent of the 4-hour chart level yesterday, and the low point of 1762 yesterday. Gold today&#39;s suggestion is to go short in the 1781-83 area, stop loss at 1788, and target at 1773. Gold is currently uncertain whether the market trend is long or short. After all, after yesterday’s rise, today’s retracement is greater. If the retracement of this wave is lower than 1762, the next time it rises again, then the market is on the high side. Rising, the next time if it breaks the high point of 1789 today, then the 1800 will be at risk of breaking, and if today’s price retracement falls below the position of 1762 or after today’s decline, tomorrow will extend its downward trend to break the situation of 1762, then This is the reversal of the entire trend. After falling below 1762, the decline may be very large, in the 1730-1720 area. This is the general expectation. On the whole, today&#39;s gold short-term operation ideas suggest that the callback is mainly long, and the rebound short is supplemented. The top focus is on the first-line resistance of 1780-1785, and the short-term below focuses on the first-line support of 1740-1745.\n",

      "Tokyo-bound Sampson sets Aust rifle record. Shooter Dane Sampson has struck career-best form as he builds towards a third Olympics, setting a national record while winning the 50m rifle event at the South Australia championships. Sampson registered a score of 462 points to claim gold in the three positions event. The performance bettered Sampson's own national record of 460.7 points, which he achieved at last month's Wingfield grand prix. The score was also notably higher than what Italy's Niccolo Campriani (458.8) and Poland's Tomasz Bartnik (460.4) produced to win gold at the 2016 Olympics and 2018 world championships respectively. \"It's good to be shooting PBs at this stage. It was a world-class finals score,\" Sampson said, having previously competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. \"You are unlikely to lose many competitions with that score. \"I definitely feel that I am getting better and better and I am tracking well for Tokyo.\" Sampson and other members of Australia's shooting team for the 2021 Olympics are set to come together for a pre-Games camp on July 4-19. The camp is intended to mimic the biosecurity bubble and strict protocols that await in Tokyo.\n",

      "What’s your role in AngloGold Ashanti? – Sam Jonah questioned. After his public address to Rotary Club in Accra, Sam Kwesi Esson Jonah KBE, has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the Executive. The latest criticism is coming from Paul Adom-Otchere, host of Good Evening Ghana (GEG), who in his biweekly show on Metro TV, tried to ‘punch holes’ in the senior stateman’s speech. According to him, Sam Jonah KBE, must have had a role in Ashanti Gold which later turned into AngloGold Ashanti, therefore, he should be able to tell the young people of Ghana the role he played while working with the company. On his show, Thursday, April 29, 2021, Adom-Otchere stated that, if Sam Jonah KBE wants to talk about the future of Ghana, then he must first of all open up about his past. “Sam Jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past...it behoves him to make statements about his past. If he won’t say anything at all, at least we know his role with Adisadel College and AshGold Football Club, we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society, the Ashanti transaction,” Paul Adom-Otchere said on his show monitored by GhanaWeb. He indicated that, there are two Ashanti transactions, one was failed by the government of Ghana, which left a lot of rancour’s between JJ Rawlings and Sam Jonah and their relationship broke off completely. “We don’t know the details. Sam Jonah must come and tell us. And then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002, this time it was supported by the JA Kufuor government and it was successful. In both transactions, there was a critical decision about the heritage of the Ghanaian young person; because this gold resource, which is a Ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way, was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today Sam Jonah is concerned about? “Was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future? Was there an option with Randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of Ghana?” he asked. Adom-Otchere stressed that, Sam Jonah KBE must answer these questions. “He [Sam Jonah] is a big man, he has been around for a very long time, and he comes and says the youth of Ghana, I now feel the responsibility to speak and you don’t tell us what you’ve been doing in the past, when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of Ghana since 1983; you won’t tell us what has happened about that…?” Paul Adom-Otchere argues that, Sam Jonah’s answer to the question will help the Ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea. “So that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time. If that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time, it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important,” he stressed.\n",

(\"Company\") and its consolidated subsidiaries (together \"Komatsu\") have engaged in the three- year mid-term management plan (FY2019 - 2021), \"DANTOTSU Value - FORWARD Together for Sustainable Growth\" for its 100th anniversary in 2021 and beyond. Under the mid-term management plan, launched in April 2019, Komatsu upholds three pillars of growth strategies of 1) value creation by means of innovation, 2) growth strategies based on business reforms, and 3) structural reforms for growth. While economic activities remain sluggish due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Komatsu will continue to make efforts for sustainable growth through a positive cycle of improving earnings and solving ESG issues into the future. For the fiscal year under review (April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021), the second year of the mid-term management plan, consolidated net sales totaled JPY 2,189.5 billion, down 10.4% from the previous fiscal year. Under unclear and uncertain conditions as affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, demand showed steady recovery, centering on construction equipment, in the second six-month period. However, sales decreased from the previous fiscal year, as full-year demand was critically affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the first six-month period. In the industrial machinery and others business, sales fell from the previous fiscal year, as affected by sluggish capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools. With respect to profits for the fiscal year under review, operating income dropped by 33.3% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 167.3 billion. This was mainly due to reduced sales volume, and changes in the compositions of sales, in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, as well as the Japanese yen's appreciation, even while Komatsu worked to reduce fixed costs. The operating income ratio decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 7.6%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies fell by 27.0% to JPY 162.7 billion. Net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd. totaled JPY 106.2 billion, down 30.9%.

Business results by operation are described below. Construction, Mining and Utility Equipment For the fiscal year under review, sales of the construction, mining and utility equipment business decreased by 10.6% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 1,975.9 billion. Segment profit fell by 36.7% to JPY 143.7 billion. Komatsu promoted efforts of focus defined in the three pillars of growth strategies in the mid-term management plan. With respect to automation, autonomy, electrification, and remote control of construction, mining, and utility equipment, i.e., an effort of focus in value creation by means of innovation, Komatsu continued to strengthen the Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) for mining, increasing the total number of AHS trucks in operation to 352 units as of March 31, 2021. Komatsu also advanced remote control verification tests of the large ICT-intensive mining bulldozer D375Ai-8 over commercial 5G network, while continuing efforts to develop an optimization platform designed to improve the safety and optimize operations at customers' mines. Concerning electrification of construction equipment, Komatsu embarked on PoC (Proof of Concept) verification tests of small and medium-sized hydraulic excavators powered by the lithium-ion battery system. With respect to the \"SMARTCONSTRUCTION Digital Transformation\", a solutions business for construction workplaces, Komatsu is appealing its role as a solution provider to help customers optimize their construction work. To accelerate the pace of achieving digital transformation of construction workplaces, Komatsu continued to promoted the installation of its retrofit kits, which offer ICT functions to conventional construction equipment. Concerning an effort of focus of the growth strategies based on business reforms, Komatsu strengthened the recycle-oriented business, establishing a new Reman plant in Southern Africa for the Reman business which remanufactures and reuses components. In the forest machinery business, Komatsu also strengthened the market introduction of machines designed to promote silviculture (growing and cultivating forest crops). As part of the structural reforms for growth, Komatsu continued its efforts to reassess Komatsu Mining Corp.'s unprofitable business and optimize their production capacity by restructuring production of underground coal mining equipment, selling its conveyor business in the United States and Australia, and transferring its production of roof supports in the United Kingdom.

Japan For the fiscal year under review, demand remained steady, centering on public works, on which the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a small impact. Nevertheless, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as adversely affected by slack private-sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six-month period. Americas In North America, sales dropped from the previous fiscal year. While demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry, it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and that for construction and mining equipment remained slack in the energy-related sector. In Latin America, demand for construction equipment remained steady in Brazil, and sales of mining equipment increased to Chilean copper mines. However, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as mainly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in the first six- month period. Europe and CIS In Europe, sales decreased from the previous fiscal year, as demand remained sluggish in the first six-month period, although demand was on a recovery track from the adverse effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the major markets of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as in Italy. In CIS, sales declined, affected by sluggish demand for mining equipment in coal mines and depreciation of the Russian ruble, while demand was steady in gold mines and that for construction equipment was on a recovery track in infrastructure development and energy-related sectors. China While the share of sales made by domestic manufacturers increased, demand remained steady, supported by the government's economic stimulus measures, such as infrastructure investment, after containing the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Furthermore, demand advanced in the fiscal year under review, driven by the post-Chinese New Year sales season in February, and because the previous year's sales season in February was pushed back by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, sales increased from the previous fiscal year. Asia and Oceania In Asia, demand showed steady recovery, centering on construction equipment, in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in Indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices. However, sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year, as particularly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the first six-month period. In Oceania, sales increased, supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron ore mines, as well as for construction equipment. Middle East and Africa In the Middle East, sales improved from the previous fiscal year, supported by steady demand, especially in Turkey, while demand remained slack in Saudi Arabia, largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In Africa, demand for construction equipment remained slack in Southern Africa, mainly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions, sales declined, as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well. Retail Finance While assets increased, reflecting an increase in new contracts centering on North America as well as the affects of foreign exchange rates in the fourth quarter, revenues decreased by 6.4% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 66.3 billion, as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine-month period. Segment profit fell by 16.6% to JPY 10.5 billion, mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use. Industrial Machinery and Others For the fiscal year under review, sales fell by 3.6% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 171.2 billion. This was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools, as well as their delayed installation at customers' overseas workplaces, especially under the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Meanwhile, segment profit increased by 19.3% to JPY 16.3 billion, as sales remained steady for Excimer laser-related business in the semiconductor market. [Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2022] (From April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022) In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review, returning to the level prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. By region, Komatsu anticipates demand will expand, especially in Asia, North America and Latin America. In China, Komatsu expects that demand will decline from the fiscal year under review, when the post-Chinese New Year sales season occurred twice. Nevertheless, Komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review. Furthermore, Komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore, copper, and gold mines, while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines. With respect to profits, Komatsu expects that they will advance, reflecting an increase in volume of sales, differences in composition of sales, and improved selling prices. In the retail finance business, Komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve, mainly due to an increase in new contracts. In the industrial machinery and others business, Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as sales of machine tools and the Excimer laser-related business should grow, respectively, in the automobile manufacturing industry and on the semiconductor market. As preconditions for its projection, Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates will be as follows: USD1=JPY 105.0, EUR1=JPY 124.0, and RMB1=JPY 16.0.

(2) Financial Conditions As of March 31, 2021, while inventories decreased from the previous fiscal year-end, total assets increased by JPY 131.1 billion to JPY 3,784.8 billion, due largely to the Japanese yen's depreciation against the U.S. dollar and some other currencies as well as increased receivables. Interest-bearing debt decreased by JPY 102.3 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to JPY 909.9 billion. Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity increased by JPY 140.6 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to JPY 1,912.2 billion. As a result, Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' ratio increased by 2.0 percentage points from the previous fiscal year-end, to 50.5%. For the fiscal year under review, net cash provided by operating activities totaled JPY 354.1 billion, an increase of JPY 58.9 billion from the previous fiscal year, largely reflecting decreased inventories. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to JPY 163.0 billion, a decrease of JPY 27.8 billion from the previous fiscal year, due mainly to the purchase of fixed assets. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to JPY 199.6 billion (as compared to JPY 3.4 billion used for the previous fiscal year), mainly due to the repayment of debt and payment of cash dividends. After adding the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations to the total amount of each cash flow, as of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled JPY 241.8 billion, a decrease of JPY 5.8 billion from the previous fiscal year-end. [Trends of Financial Conditions Indicators] (Fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019) 2021 2020 2019 Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio (%) 50.5 48.5 49.9 Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio at aggregate market 85.4 46.0 66.7 value (%) Years of debt redemption 2.6 3.4 4.6 Notes: 1) Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio: Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity/Total assets           Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio at aggregate market value: Aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock/Total assets    Years of debt redemption: Interest-bearing debt/Net cash provided by operating activities     Basic Policy for Redistribution of Profits and Dividends for the Fiscal Year under Review and Next Fiscal Year    Komatsu is building a sound financial position and enhancing its competitiveness in order to increase its sustainable corporate value. Concerning cash dividends, Komatsu has the policy of continuing stable payment of dividends after comprehensively considering consolidated business results and reviewing future investment plans, cash flows and the like. Specifically, Komatsu has the policy of maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of 40% or higher. As described earlier in this report, while demand declined in the construction, mining, and utility equipment business, as adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it has recovered sooner than expected, since the third quarter, centering on construction equipment. As a result, both sales and profits for the year outperformed the projection of consolidated business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, which Komatsu announced on October 28, 2020. Concerning cash dividends for the fiscal year under review, after considering consolidated business results for the fiscal year under review and future business prospects under its dividend policy, the Company is planning to increase the year-end common stock dividend per share by JPY 2 from the earlier projection of JPY 25 per share. At the same time, the Company plans to pay the 100th anniversary (May 13, 2021) commemorative cash dividend of JPY 10 per share. As a result, year-end cash dividends for the fiscal year under review should amount to JPY 37 per share, i.e., JPY 12 more than the latest projection of cash dividends. Annual cash dividends should total JPY 55 per share, including the interim cash dividend which has already been paid, and which is showing a decrease of JPY 39 per share from the previous fiscal year, ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, the consolidated payout ratio will translate into 48.9%. This dividend amount will be proposed to the 152nd ordinary general meeting of shareholders (scheduled for June 18, 2021). Regarding annual cash dividends for the fiscal year, ending March 31, 2022, the Company plans to pay JPY 62 per share, an increase of JPY 7 per share from the fiscal year under review.

      "Originally posted by kervio: ↑ I think the update said median age of the first set of patients was around mid 50s and median age of the later set of patients was around 69, so they would have only had to have put the inclusion criteria in half way through the trial when the evidence was emerging that age was a huge factor in deaths in order to have a successful trial. This is the big \"what if\" that might have sent the SP to $10, FDA approval, lives saved etc.We can give them a pass on not knowing that up front for sure because of the speed in which the trial moved forwards on, but I think some reactivity would have saved the day here once more was known about covid (in the same way that we found out about comorbidities leading to higher rates of death).I disagree with this: \"This disease has been totally wacky in respect of different age cohorts, and no one has or has had any idea what is going to happen to any given age group once confronted with the disease or results/impact. COVID has everyone flummoxed.\" until the Brazil variant turned everything on its head (which happened after the trial) there was lots of clear evidence in white papers about the effect of age on covid mortality. The inclusion criteria is there to stop random chance from derailing your study, so if they had say 10 or so 80yo patients that were enrolled and bound to die no matter what it lessons the effect of your treatment on a saveable demographic within your cohort. I agree with your excitement on what the results though, and I think this therapy has some big potential to show effect and get approval in a confirmatory trial with appropriate design. It's better than I expected the results to be. Expand Hey,@kervio. Good points on age effect. I guess I was thinking more broadly, say in respect of MIS-C in kids, under-50s getting blood clots with the Astra Zeneca and J&J vaccines, etc. A lot about COVID has been very unpredictable.As well, we don't know what conversations, if any, were had between MSB, NIH, the FDA and the DSMB. Clearly, someone made the decision not to modify the inclusion criteria and continue the trial, opting to halt it, instead. Most likely NOT MSB's choice, and I doubt they would have been given enough information by the DSMB to allow them to make this call on their own. I am clearly not qualified to speak on the issue, of course!LeftYahoo had a good point about the silver lining here, though - we get the full trial results that much earlier, with it having been halted. Fingers crossed the NIH, the FDA and Novartis are as excited about these amazing results as we are!\n",

      "European stocks rely on stable investment sentiment in the early stage. The economic growth in the United States in the first quarter was better than expected, and the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time last week decreased. Coupled with the Fed&#39;s dovish remarks, the market sentiment was positive, and European stock markets stabilized in the early stages.

During the period, personal consumption rose 10.7%, slightly higher than estimated . The London copper futures rose above the level of US$10,000 per ton. It reached a high of US$10,008 earlier, which is close to the high of US$10,190 in 2011, and it has recently softened to US$9,881.

      "3 common mistakes investors make with penny stocks - The Motley Fool UK. In for a penny, in for a pound? Penny stocks can seem appealing. The idea that an investment that costs a matter of pence could generate pounds of rewards can be beguiling. But there are a lot of simple mistakes investors make choosing penny stocks. Here are three I’ve observed. Focus on price not value Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s say my children could travel to school in the cheapest bus the school can buy — or the most expensive. Which would I prefer? The answer seems obvious. For most people, quality is worth paying for. Yet penny stocks can focus our attention on price not value. The legendary investor Warren Buffett said that “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. A penny stock could indeed turn out to be good value. But to assess what the underlying value is, I’d look not just at the price. I’dd also consider the company’s future ability to generate profits and create shareholder value. Penny stocks and balance sheets One common mistake investors make is buying on share price alone without looking at the company’s balance sheet. Imagine buying a second hand car for £100. That might sound like a bargain. But if it needs to have an MOT the following week that identifies £3,000 of necessary repairs, even the £100 price tag could seem like a bad bargain in retrospect. It’s the same when a company has a lot of debt or other future financial obligations that dwarf its financial resources. How will it pay them? Will it have a rights issue and dilute shareholders as a penny stock like Hammerson did last year? Balance sheets scare many people. But they aren’t as technical as they may sound. Before investing in any penny stocks I’d always spend at least a few minutes looking at a company’s recent balance sheets. Seeing what a company’s debt profile looks like is a crucial indicator of its financial health, in my view. Single-asset focus A lot of penny stocks are exclusively or mainly focused on a single asset. I find that’s particularly true with early-stage resource stocks. For example, Bacanora Lithium is pinning a lot of hope on one project in Mexico. Sometimes, such a focus is positive and a lack of diversification can amplify rewards. If a company owns one mining licence and literally strikes gold, its return on capital could be huge. But the reverse is true as well – if a company is over-concentrated in one asset, the lack of diversification can disproportionately damage it. Single-asset focus improves potential reward only by increasing potential risk, in many cases. That matters because, as Warren Buffett reminds us: “Rule number one: never lose money. Rule number two: never forget rule number one”. That can be hard to do. But by learning from common mistakes other investors make, I hope I can improve my likely returns when identifying penny stocks to consider for my portfolio. \n",

      "Royal Canadian Mint Reports Profits and Performance for 2020. OTTAWA, ON, April 30, 2021 /CNW/ - The Royal Canadian Mint (the \"Mint\") is pleased to announce its financial results for 2020 that provide insight into our activities, the markets influencing our businesses and our expectations for the next 12 months. \"In 2020, employees of the Royal Canadian Mint demonstrated their ability to innovate and deliver great products in a very challenging operating environment\" said Marie Lemay, President and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint. \"Their hard work contributed to the Mint's success. Employees pivoted quickly in the face of disruption allowing the Mint to generate strong profits.\"   \"The Mint continues to respond to the unprecedented situation with COVID-19 in a proactive way that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees. We have adapted our production to be able to continue delivering critical services in support of the essential mining and financial sectors, while adhering to strict new protocols to ensure our work environment is a safe one.\" \"One very special initiative in 2020 was our Recognition Medal, created to recognize frontline workers while raising money for the Breakfast Club of Canada's COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Employees donated their time to this project and thanks to their generosity and the contrinutions of thousands of Canadians, the Mint was able to make a $400,000 donation to the Breakfast Club in 2020.\"  The financial results should be read in conjunction with the Mint's annual report available at www.mint.ca. All monetary amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Financial and Operational Highlights The Mint increased its revenue by 74% in 2020 as a result of exceptionally strong global market demand for bullion while consolidated profit before income tax and other items was $27.5 million for the year (2019 – $42.3 million). Higher bullion volumes sold in 2020 increased the Mint's revenue and cost of sales proportionately; however, the Mint's profit margin was impacted in 2020 by lower revenue from its other businesses, without a corresponding decrease in costs. In particular, the Mint continued to pay its employees and did not reduce any fixed costs during the periods of suspended or modified production as a result of the pandemic impacting the Mint's profit margin in 2020 by approximately $6 million. Consolidated revenue increased to $2,527.6 million in 2020 (2019 - $1,453.4 million). Gold bullion volumes increased more than 100% year over year and were 982.8 thousand ounces (2019 – 483.0 thousand ounces) while silver bullion volumes were 29.5 million ounces (2019 – 22.8 million ounces). Sales of numismatic products decreased to $91.9 million in 2020 (2019 - $116.8 million) due mainly to the temporary suspension of numismatic product production as a result of COVID-19 in 2020. Revenue from the Foreign Circulation business decreased 2% to $64.2 million (2019 - $65.4 million) with production and/or shipments of 838 million coins in 2020 and blanks compared to 1,308 million coins and blanks in 2019. Canadian circulation coins produced and sold to the Department of Finance for inventory were 229 million pieces in 2020 (2019 – 385 million pieces) while coins sold to financial institutions to meet demand decreased 8% year over year. Operating expenses, overall, increased 4% year over year to $98.5 million (2019 – $94.5 million) as the Mint focused on enhanced organizational resiliency in 2020 and the development of its updated long-term strategic vision and the strategy for the Mint's future business transformation.   Cash and cash equivalents increased to $67.3 million (December 31, 2019 - $65.5 million) after the Mint declared and paid a $20 million dividend to its Shareholder, the Government of Canada, in 2020. Cash and cash equivalents remain at the level required to support the Mint's operations.   Consolidated results and financial performance(in CAD $ millions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019)  Year ended December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 $ Change % Change Revenue $ 2,527.6 $ 1,453.4 $ 1,074.2 74 Profit before income tax and other items1 $ 27.5 $ 42.3 $ (14.8) (35) Profit before income tax and other items margin 1.1% 2.9% Profit for the period $ 37.7 $ 34.8 (1)   A reconciliation from profit for the period to profit before income tax and other items is included on page 35 of the Mint's 2020 annual report.   As at December 31, 2020 December 31,  2019 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 67.3 $ 65.5 $ 1.8 3 Inventories $ 57.6 $ 94.9 $ (37.3) (39) Capital assets $ 161.1 $ 173.9 $ (12.8) (7) Total assets $ 379.4 $ 429.9 $ (50.5) (12) Working capital $ 112.9 $ 102.5 $ 10.4 10 As part of its business continuity plan, the Mint continues to actively monitor its global supply chain and logistics networks in support of its continued operations.

      "Hammersmith Bridge: Bridge of sighs and a shameful collective catalogue of failure. Clemmie Watkins used to have a 10-minute walk to school across . Since September, it has become a 40-minute bike ride via  on roads plagued by speeding drivers and riverside paths that flood when the Thames rises. On winter nights, even adults avoid her unlit route home across Dukes Meadows, a haunt of muggers and doggers. On Wednesday the 13-year-old slipped and fell crossing a wet Barnes bridge, cutting herself and ruining her school skirt. “It’s really annoying,” she said. “If it floods it’s so much longer in the rain. It’s not good.” by Hammersmith and Fulham council when cracks were detected in its pedestals. The crossing was kept open to pedestrians and cyclists until August last year, but the cracks widened. Since then, the effect on  has been “catastrophic”, . About 4,000 vehicles a day divert via her Putney constituency. Even at 7am, the already polluted approaches to Putney bridge, the nearest alternative crossing, are gridlocked. The inability to reopen the bridge has made London a laughing stock. Politicians blame each other while residents despair. Ms Anderson describes it as an “international embarrassment”. It has even made the New York Times. On September 9 last year, Transport Secretary , accompanied by Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey, visited the bridge. In a video, Mr Shapps vowed to “take control” and “get it fixed and reopened”. . Yesterday it met for the 15th time. The taskforce includes representatives from Transport for London and Heidi Alexander, Sadiq Khan’s deputy mayor for transport. But Mr Khan said this week that the taskforce had been little more than a “talking shop to kick the can down the road”. Clemmie’s mother, Julia Watkins, a member of the Hammersmith Bridge SOS residents’ group, agrees. “You can’t walk over a taskforce,” she said. “They have done nothing. They were meant to be knocking heads together. Baroness Vere points the finger at Hammersmith and Fulham council. The council points the finger at Grant Shapps.” A resident survey found some feeling suicidal because of the closure. Almost nine in 10 said they had suffered worse mental health. The apolitical Hammersmith Society, in a letter to the Prime Minister, said: “The communities on both sides of the river are unified in their anger, their disappointment and their despair.” There is a growing acknowledgement that only the Government has the financial might to break the deadlock. The council owns the bridge but cannot afford the £141 million restoration bill. Mr Shapps wants the council to pay half the bill.  has provided about £20 million for investigations and design work, including £4 million for a temporary ferry and repairs from a government Covid bail-out last year. “The Government should be able to break this deadlock,” Ms Watkins said. “They could have straightaway funded a temporary pedestrian and cycling bridge. Instead they went for this ludicrous ferry. It’s completely inadequate.” Even the ferry has been delayed. An initial plan was to have it start operating last autumn. Uber Boat by Thames Clippers has won the contract but two temporary piers have yet to be constructed. Residents fear services may not start until November. “Our contract is to have it running by the beginning of October, but we are in negotiations with TfL to accelerate that,” said a spokesman for Beckett Rankine, which will design the piers. “TfL would like it ready at the start of September, but there are a lot of things that have to go right. Normally it would take a year to build a new pier.” The contract between TfL and Thames Clippers is for a minimum of 12 months, to a maximum of five years. Adults will be charged £1.55 per crossing, though children will travel free. There will be two ferries, with a third as back-up. The crossing will take 90 seconds, with a boat every five to seven minutes in peak hours. “It will be a huge improvement for the residents,” the Beckett Rankine spokesman said. “It will be a very slick service. Thames Clippers know what they are doing.” The source added: “It’s a lot cheaper than a temporary bridge.” The council’s preferred option is a “double decker” bridge. Designed by architects Foster + Partners and specialist bridge engineers COWI, it would cost about £100 million — £41 million less than fully restoring the existing bridge. This could allow the bridge to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists in summer next year, and to drivers two months later — four years earlier than otherwise planned. But motorists would face an estimated £3 toll. The other hope for a “quick win” rests with engineers who have analysed the structural integrity of the pedestals. It may be the case that the ironwork has stabilised and the bridge could be safe to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists. The engineers’ report was submitted to the DfT three weeks ago. But sources say that “further engineering analysis and checks need to be completed” — and this could take a further three months. Behind the scenes there is concern about safety. The Government wants the council to retain liability should anything go wrong. Residents are furious at the thought that a “risk-averse culture” could be used as an excuse to keep the bridge closed. “On that basis, politicians should close every bridge in the country,” one said, noting that teenagers continue to climb the railings to cross the bridge at night and use it as a skateboard park. “If they continue to do that after the engineers’ report shows it’s safe, that is just despicable. They’re ruining people’s lives.” The key date is when the clocks go back in October, when the thousands a day who follow Clemmie’s route risk being stranded on the wrong side of the river. Michelle Coulter, another member of Hammersmith Bridge SOS, whose daughters Iris, 16, and Lana, 13, also attend school in Hammersmith, said children were often unable to board the replacement buses. Under Covid rules, the single-deckers can only carry 14 passengers. “Since August it’s become so stressful, I cannot tell you,” she said. “My youngest finishes school at 4pm. In winter she was getting home at 5.30pm, sometimes 6pm. That was by bus.” Mr Khan accuses the Government of “dither and delay” and failing to honour promises made before the 2019 General Election. The council submitted its double-decker bridge proposal in February, but it is regarded by the DfT to be lacking detail. Two weeks ago, minister Rachel Maclean accused the council of wearing “gold-tinted lenses” and said a “blank cheque” would not be forthcoming. The DfT said it could not comment due to pre-election purdah restrictions. Sadiq Khan (Lab) Keen to have the bridge reopened to pedestrians and cyclists if engineers find the structure safe but says the bridge will only fully reopen to vehicles when the Government covers the bulk of the cost. A TfL-funded ferry service is due to start in the autumn. Shaun Bailey (Con) Promises to make the ferry free, build a temporary road bridge and fully repair the existing bridge, which he would rename the Prince Philip bridge. Says it is essential the bridge can carry vehicles and would not impose a toll on motorists. Says TfL should have funded the full repairs as soon as the bridge closed in 2019. He would fund his ideas by establishing a TfL investment fund. Sian Berry (Green) Believes the Department for Transport should provide “at least the majority of the costs” of repairing the bridge, and wants a date to be set for the reopening of the bridge for walking and cycling. Luisa Porritt (Lib Dem) “The Government is the only body with the funds to foot the bill. The mayor could make a bigger contribution if the £2 billion Silvertown Tunnel road project was axed.”\n",

      "Lucea Primary School fighting back challenges caused. THE Lucea Primary School, which provided educational instruction to thousands of students from across Hanover and adjacent parishes, is fighting back the the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  Principal of the 62-year-old institution, Yazmin Anderson Jackson, says the students and staff have embraced the changes that have transformed the modalities of lessons that are delivered and how stakeholders interact with each other. Students preparing for the Grade Six Primary Exit Profile (PEP) Ability Test were given an opportunity to have face-to-face classes between February 1, 2021 and March 18, 2021. However, the spike in COVID-19 cases in the parish has forced classes to return online. Grade six social studies teacher Francena Black is highly motivated and hopes to pass on her enthusiasm to her students. Black, who is faced with the daily challenges of keeping her students motivated, said being online requires new approaches to lesson delivery. She has incorporated different modalities to maintain her students' interest. One such method is through the use of different resource persons to teach subjects in their areas of expertise. “We find that it really gets them engaged. Having [different resource persons] throughout the day, we find that this makes a great difference,” Black said, citing “guest teachers” from the Forestry Department, the Hanover Municipal Corporation and the Jamaica Information Service . The school, which had its genesis in an old soldier barracks near the seaside, is currently located in Malcolm Heights, which overlooks the aquamarine waters of Lucea Harbour. At present, there are more than 625 students on roll and 31 teachers on staff. Lucea Primary is propelled by the vision of excellence for all. In light of this, programmes are implemented to help students become well rounded. The motto, 'Soaring High on Integrity', alludes to that. Anderson Jackson is proud to note that students have earned scholarships due to their high academic performance. “Over the years, we have excellent performances at the JCDC festival, winning many gold medals as well as silver medals in dance, music and speech,” she said. “Students are also involved in sports and have been crowned parish champions in cricket and football,” Anderson Jackson notes, pointing out that the school has showcased its talents in Spanish and 4-H competitions and continues to provide these avenues for self-expression and development for its students. She said that COVID-19 has forced the school to use the Google Suite platform, and “we have been coping quite well” Despite the challenges of poor Internet connectivity in some areas, loss of electricity occasionally and the lack of devices for some students, Anderson Jackson is optimistic that her school community will continue to rise. “Our highly trained staff goes beyond the call of duty to ensure that students are catered for at all levels and that the school lives up to its mission to provide a system which secures quality holistic education for all students,” she told JIS News.

      "Advertorial (?) in the Australian from Anzac Day ..cheers https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/dgo-gold-aiming-to-strike-a-balance-in-gold-exploration/news-story/231d9ce048bfd7d7f87545741008db15DGO Gold aiming to strike a balance in gold explorationDGO Gold is hoping it has created a strategic investment model that will reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia. Picture: BloombergDAMON KITNEYVICTORIAN BUSINESS EDITOR6:42PM APRIL 25, 2021Melbourne investment banker Bruce Parncutt calls his latest plaything a “gold discovery company”.Neither an explorer nor a miner, the ASX-listed DGO Gold — of which Mr Parncutt has been an executive director for the past year — is looking to carve out a unique niche in the Australian gold sector.Its game plan is to make strategic equity investments in West Australian brownfield gold discoveries, bankroll themwith additional capital and combine them with its own pursuit of largely-ignored exploration opportunities.Mr Parncutt said he hopes DGO has created a model that can reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia.“Gold is our fourth largest export so the industry is pretty important for the nation. We do the mining part well but I’m not so sure we do the exploration part well. Especially the brownfields guys who need to get their resource to some scale,” he said. “Most junior explorers find a piece of ground and they raise the capital and explore. We think we are adding intelligent value to that process.” DGO is also a unique human story, combining the skills of a career investment banker and former boss of McIntosh Securities in Mr Parncutt, with the exploration expertise of one of the resource sector’s most famed geologists, Ed Eshuys.As Joseph Gutnick’s exploration director in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr Eshuys led the teams that discovered the Plutonic, Bronzewing and Jundee gold deposits and the Cawse nickel deposit. Before those triumphs, Mr Eshuys also had involvement in the Maggie Hays and Mariners nickel discoveries in the 1970s.He is now DGO Gold’s executive chairman and is working closely with Mr Parncutt — who has been on the board since 2018 — and DGO’s management team to develop two sizeable WA gold resources and to explore for more.“We do bring together a unique set of skills. It is all very well to have the money but to apply that you need the technical skills” Mr Eshuys said.“Bruce and I do debate between ourselves our respective points of view and invariably come up with a consensus. That has led us to a disciplined approach to take DGO from where it was to where it is now.”DGO Gold directors Ed Eshuys and Bruce Parncutt.DGO Gold initially evaluated 100 gold explorers and their projects. Ten ASX juniors made the shortlist before DGO narrowed it down to two, taking strategic stakes in booming Pilbara gold explorer De Grey Mining and Leonora gold explorer NTM Gold.DGO has a string of major greenfield exploration projects of its own being drilled, including on prime South Australian ground owned by junior explorer Investigator Resources as the first stage to earning an 80 per cent stake in the latter’s Pernatty copper project. DGO also has a 40 per cent interest in Yilgarn Exploration Ventures, which is drilling in the Leonora district of Western Australia.“One of the critical things we found when we were talking to all the juniors was that they didn’t understand the need to have at least 3 million ounces to have something of meaningful scale,” Mr Eshuys said.“Part of our discussions with these companies was about raising sufficient funds to do the job properly. That is where De Grey came to the party. They did understand they needed to raise more money and they did that.”The strategy has seen DGO Gold shares soar from just 17c four years ago, and $1.70 last year when Mr Parncutt became an executive, to close on Friday at $3.63.They soared over $4 in September last year on the back of the coronavirus-fuelled surge in the gold price, which saw it spike to $US2056 per ounce last August.While gold prices have trended lower since the start of 2021 amid rising US Treasury yields and an increasingly positive outlook for the global economic recovery, the DGO share price has held up.DGO now owns 16 per cent of De Grey, which is drilling out a significant Pilbara gold discovery. It also has board representation and has supported De Grey’s capital raisings, including a $25m round last September.“De Grey is in a unique position in terms of its Pilbara land position. That is one of our key elements when we invest and explore,” Mr Eshuys said.Following the merger late last year of NTM Gold with Dacian Gold, DGO will now emerge with a 10 per cent stake in Dacian.Of the $25m raised last September, $8m was also pegged for greenfield exploration.The value of DGO’s stake in De Grey covers its $225m market capitalisation, meaning the market is currently attributing no value to DGO’s substantial exploration interests.DGO has attracted some big name investors, including stockbroking veteran Tom Klinger, one of Christopher Skase’s biggest backers through the 1980s and another former McIntosh managing director. Others are former stockbroking resources turned private equity fund adviser Peter Woodford, the rich-lister Costa family member Robert Costa and Regal Funds Management.\n",

      "Global gold demand, first quarter near low level for the first time in 13 years Investor sales. [London, 29th Reuters] --Global gold demand in the first quarter of this year has remained near its lowest level since 2008, according to a quarterly report released by the World Gold Council (WGC), an international gold research institute. It was. While Asian consumer buying has returned, investor sales have expanded in Europe and North America. Last year, as the spread of the new coronavirus hit the global economy, investors were increasingly buying gold as a safe haven. At the same time, lockdowns to curb the spread of infection have slowed sales of gold jewelery, gold nuggets and gold coins in China and India, which are normally the two biggest consumers. As the global economy recovers, this trend is now reversing, with investors shrinking their holdings and Asian consumer buying returning. According to the WGC, global gold demand from January to March this year was 815.7 tons, a slight increase from 813.7 tons in the previous quarter. However, it decreased by 23% year-on-year. Consumer demand in China was 286.4 tonnes, the highest level since the first quarter of 2017. On the other hand, exchange-traded fund (ETF) gold holdings fell by 177.9 tons, the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2013. Due to the sale by ETF, the gold price fell from the record high of 1 ounce = $ 2072.50 in August last year to around $ 1,700 in March. According to the WGC, this helped boost demand for Asians. In April, ETF sales slowed sharply and gold prices picked up towards $ 1800. WGC analyst Christian Gopaul said consumers and investors&#39; demand for gold this year is likely to remain resilient, albeit below its recent peak. Gold purchased by the central bank in the first quarter was 95.5 tonnes, the highest level since the second quarter of last year. However, it was well below the typical level seen in 2018 and 2019.

      "Under-supplied metal palladium races past $3,000/oz for first time. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT.       Palladium pierced the $3,000 an ounce high for the first time on Friday, powered by persistent concerns about short supply of the metal used primarily for emissions-controlling devices in automobiles. Palladium was last up 1% to $2,984.68 per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $3,007.73. It was on track to post a monthly gain as well. \"Palladium is in a structural deficit since 10 years. We have seen above ground inventories falling to very low levels, and now the price gives a signal to investors still holding it,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. \"The commodity ... comes with very low trading volume so it can be very illiquid and this is making the moves even more crazy. This rally can continue, particularly if car sales start to improve going forward.\" Demand from the auto industry is rising and expected to climb further as a semiconductor chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production eases later this year. But Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said prices are unlikely to see a sustained run above $3,000, with substitution likely to bring prices down as the year goes on. \"At this level more and more car manufacturers will think about substitution (of palladium for platinum).\" A shift to electric vehicles may also eventually erode palladium demand, although tightening environmental rules have forced carmakers to use more and more palladium in their gasoline engines in recent years. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,769.00. Data showed on Thursday that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter. Separately, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed a dip in initial claims for state unemployment benefits. Silver fell 0.5% to $25.96 per ounce, though was poised for an over 6% monthly gain - its biggest since last December. Platinum was up 0.7% at $1,206.   (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Peter Hobson in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)    Dear Reader,  Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

      "China&#39;s gold production in the first quarter shrinks by 10% and consumption is 94%. The China Gold Association announced that the domestic raw material gold production in the first quarter of this year was 74.44 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 9.92%. Among them, China National Gold, Shandong Gold, Zijin Mining, Shandong Zhaojin and other large gold conglomerates produced 30.78 tons of mineral gold, accounting for the proportion of the country. Up to 52.25%. According to the association, the actual consumption of gold in the country during the period was 288.2 tons, an increase of 93.9% year-on-year. Among them, gold jewellery was 169.18 tons, an increase of 83.81%. Based on the low base caused by the outbreak in the same period last year, and the results of China&#39;s overall epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development gradually appearing, the gold consumption in the first quarter has returned to the level of the same period in 2019. The scale of domestic gold ETFs continued to grow in the first quarter, with a total increase of 11.5 tons. As of the end of March, domestic gold ETF holdings were about 72.4 tons. The association stated that high-quality resources and high-quality productivity are further concentrated in large gold companies. The fall in gold prices has also prompted an increase in demand from industrial gold companies. The improvement in the macro economy and the fall in gold prices have caused physical gold investment to continue the high heat in the fourth quarter of last year, with a sharp rise year-on-year. In the first quarter of 2021, with the turnaround of the global epidemic and the steady progress of vaccination, as well as the continuous strengthening of the U.S. dollar under the large-scale fiscal stimulus of the Biden government of the United States, the price of gold fluctuated and corrected during the period.\n",

      "Can Utah Republicans survive an emerging sea of blue in the West?. That’s what’s at stake and why the race for Utah’s next Republican leader matters, outgoing Utah GOP chairman says Share this story Share All sharing options for: As surrounding states in the West continue to trend Democratic, will Utah remain a red stronghold? Or will it eventually become overtaken in an emerging sea of blue? That’s what’s at stake for Utah Republicans in the race for the Utah GOP’s next chairperson, a position largely off the radar of a public consumed by COVID-19 updates and the promise of better weather. Yet when delegates make their selection from five candidates at this weekend’s state convention, it will help determine the future of their party and its influence on Utah politics, said Derek Brown, the state GOP’s outgoing chairman, who announced last month he wouldn’t be seeking another term to spend more time with his family. “Anyone who is paying attention to the trends and to the numbers who is a Republican should be very concerned,” Brown told the Deseret News in an interview this week. “The demographic and geographic trends are not boding well for Republicans — both nationally and here in the state of Utah.”Rewind to the year 2000, when George W. Bush beat Al Gore for president. That year, the entire western U.S. voted red except for Oregon, California, Washington and purple New Mexico — though New Mexico tipped blue on a fraction of a percentage point. Since then, “one by one we’ve had states surrounding Utah that have flipped blue,” Brown said. New Mexico, though it voted red in 2004, flipped Democratic in 2008 for former President Barack Obama, and has since stayed blue. Other purple states like Colorado and Nevada have faded blue. Then Arizona, a state that has voted red since 2000, made the flip last year, when the state turned blue for President Joe Biden. “That is a Democratic shift in the western U.S. that does not bode well for Republicans, and we have not done a good job nationally of (addressing it),” Brown said, describing the difficulties Republicans have had engaging millennial voters and unifying around their platform. Outgoing Utah GOP chairman Derek Brown looks over county signs at the party’s headquarters in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 28, 2021. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Nate Silver, the editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight who is a well-known predictor of political elections, last year said “people underrate the chance that Utah could become a swing state in another couple of cycles.” In 2017, Silver told the Deseret News he’s fascinated by Utah because it looks and breathes like a blue state, even though it’s traditionally red. He said Utah “increasingly has the markers of a blue state, meaning high education levels, big tech sector, young population. So you can kind of envision a world in eight years, 12 years, 16 years in which Utah behaves more like Colorado or something, right?” “And this was before COVID,” Brown said. Add in the pandemic, which Brown said has put these concerning trends for Republicans on “steroids” because of the number of people moving from other states like New York or California and “flooding” Utah. “The people coming here ... that may help our economy, but it will definitely have an impact on the political landscape,” Brown said. So while the Utah GOP for decades has “had the luxury of a super majority,” Brown said assuming that “luxury” will last forever could spell trouble for Utah Republicans. “The luxury of a super majority can also allow a party to be sloppy and unfocused and still win elections,” Brown said. “My concern is we may not have that luxury in the next five to 10 years. And whether that is the case has everything to do with the party remaining strong and funded.” Brown said he saw it happen in Arizona last year, where he said a “weak and fractured party focused on infighting” lost in a crucial presidential year and lost a Republican seat in the U.S. Senate. “My concern is whenever a party becomes weak and unfunded and unfocused and allows itself to engage in infighting, the day follows the night. The party will begin to lose elections,” he said. “And we (in Utah) have not done that in the last few years. We have reversed that trend. But as a party we need to remain vigilant — or else we will go the way of our surrounding states.” Outgoing Utah GOP chairman Derek Brown looks over old caucus signs that weren’t used due to COVID-19 at the party’s headquarters in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 28, 2021. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Utah’s GOP Before Brown was elected in May 2019, the Utah GOP was plagued by inner turmoil: divided into camps by years of infighting over the controversial election law SB54 and in debt, owing more than $137,000. “They couldn’t pay their bills,” Brown said. “They had just lost a number of races including a congressional seat, and the fundraising was abysmal.” In 2018, former Rep. Ben McAdams beat former Rep. Mia Love and became the first Democrat to win a congressional seat in Utah since 2012. “Fast forward two years,” Brown said. “We pulled the party out of debt within a month or two. ... The party is unified in a way that it hasn’t been, notwithstanding the challenges we’ve faced. We’ve raised over $1 million. And we’ve won almost every election we’ve set out to win, including the seat in Congress that we lost.” Rep. Burgess Owens last year defeated McAdams and took back Utah’s 4th Congressional District seat for Republicans. Now, the Utah GOP must continue in the “positive direction” Brown said. Who emerges during the weekend convention to become chairperson, vice chairman, secretary and treasurer will set the future course. Who will lead? “The most important thing for a party is to support the candidates and support the brand and have an organization that is well funded and organizationally sound,” Brown said. “For me, this election is about are we going to continue to move that direction, or are we going to major in minor things? Sometimes I think political parties can focus on internal squabbles that don’t necessarily help them win elections.” Brown said he needed to remain “neutral” ahead of Saturday’s convention, so he didn’t have any endorsements or anti-endorsements for the candidates vying to take his place. But Brown did list some characteristics he believes the Utah GOP’s chairperson needs to have, including the basic ability to raise funds effectively, the ability to understand how elections are managed and won — while also having the temperament and ability to unite Utah’s Republicans rather than divide. Unity and civility is a style of politics employed by Gov. Spencer Cox — who successfully won his election last year and has seen upward trending approval ratings. It’s also a style that’s the opposite of the leader national and the majority of Utah Republicans coalesced around in 2016 and 2020 — former President Donald Trump. Trump’s divisive and polarizing style ultimately fell short on the national level in November last year. In Utah, division and polarization is not a style that’s typically successful — and not one that Brown said will position Utah’s GOP for success. “Someone who is a unifier and someone who cannot just recognize that you have people all over the political spectrum in one party, but someone who actually reaches out to all of them to bring them together is the best way forward,” Brown said. “I think someone who is divisive and focused on their own personal agenda, not only will they not unify the party, but they will force anyone who differs with them from the party. “And for a state like Utah that may trend blue,” Brown said, “that’s exactly the opposite of what we need to do.” The candidates Five candidates are running to succeed Brown, and they range in backgrounds and demographics. A look at who they are provides a picture of the GOP in Utah. There’s Tina Cannon, a former Morgan County GOP chairwoman and Morgan County councilwoman who would be the first woman to lead Utah’s GOP. There’s Stewart Peay, current chairman of the Utah County Republican Party who’s been endorsed by Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, among other legislative leaders. There’s Brad Baker, who at 22 is likely the youngest state party candidate in Utah’s party’s history. There’s Carson Jorgensen, a 31-year-old sheep rancher with a passion for agriculture and public lands. And there’s Scott Miller, former Salt Lake County GOP chairman who resigned amid controversy last month, but for which he has since rescinded his apology, defending himself by saying he’d been “Kavanaughed.” Scott Miller Miller, who lives in Riverton and was chairman of the Salt Lake County GOP for more than three years, made headlines last month after he was accused by multiple women within the Salt Lake County GOP for allowing “bullying” to occur within the party. Scott Miller Scott Miller While his four opponents agreed to phone interviews with the Deseret News this week for this story, Miller did not accept multiple requests for an interview and only answered questions via email. After initially calling the women accusers “sore losers who failed to win their respective races” in an email last month that preempted the first media report of the accusations, Miller later resigned and apologized, saying he “made a mistake with how I handled” the complaints. Since then, Miller’s backtracked. In an email sent to the Deseret News on Tuesday, Miller said he had withdrawn his apology. “I stand by my actions,” he wrote “Throughout the campaign, I immediately addressed any and all issues and complaints and I have documentation and witnesses to prove it. I never heard several of the complaints until it was presented in the press.” Miller also wrote he’s been “Kavanaughed,” comparing himself to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the federal judge who was accused of sexual assault from the ’80s during his 2018 confirmation hearings. “I believe certain women and others strategically timed salatious (sic) allegations against me to derail my campaign for state chair,” he wrote. “Many Utah Republicans seem to believe in ‘guilt by accusation’ and seem intent to deny due process to the accused. This is very disturbing.” He added: “I believe we have an obligation to investigate,” Miller wrote. “We need to get to the bottom of this issue. Let’s have due process, a fair investigation, and let the public see the facts.” Miller argues he’s the right person to lead Utah’s GOP, saying under his leadership the Salt Lake County GOP “successfully turned the Salt Lake County Council from purple to red.” He wrote he’ll keep Utah from turning purple by seeking to “expand the Republican tent. We expanded the tent in Salt Lake County. We recruited and encouraged good candidates,” saying those candidates included women, and people from diverse backgrounds. “We helped elect a greek, a doctor, and Congressman Burgess Owens, an African American.” Tina Cannon Cannon, 53, has 20 years of experience within the Utah Republican Party. She served as chairwoman for the Morgan County GOP, as well as a state convention committee member and a state convention credentials chairwoman. She was twice elected as a Morgan County councilwoman. She ran a bid last year to represent Utah’s 1st Congressional District, but faltered in the Republican convention. Tina Cannon Tina Cannon If it’s a strong organizational structure and fundraising backbone the Utah GOP needs, Cannon argues she’s the “only candidate in this race” that has that fundraising experience, pointing to her congressional run. It wasn’t until after Brown announced he was stepping down and she started getting phone calls from supporters that Cannon said she’d considered running to replace him. And then when the Salt Lake County GOP/Miller controversy hit headlines, and she said her “phone blew up.” “I was having a lot of friends in the party, particularly male friends, who were very concerned about the message this was sending and felt like it was time for another perspective,” she said. There are “very few women in Republican politics in Utah,” Cannon said, and “we each have our stories.” But she said that story did not represent the “majority of men” in Utah’s GOP, noting she’s had “incredible mentors, supporters and donors.” But she worried that story wasn’t being told “and that’s sad to me.” “Because when women see this, it discourages them from running,” she said. “Politics is hard. Politics is a blood sport. And women don’t run for the same reasons that men do. Women run to do something. Men run to be something.” So, Cannon said she decided to “step into this chaos” — a decision she made 45 minutes before the filing deadline on April 1 — in order to “encourage good women to run.” When other women don’t see other women “who are strong enough, qualified, and win, they don’t run,” she said. “This is a difficult thing,” Cannon added, “because I don’t want to run as a woman. I’m not running because I‘m a woman. I’m the best candidate. ... I have by far the most experience and the best background.” Running as the only female candidate isn’t a message that will resonate with Utah GOP delegates, she said. “It’s about being well qualified.” At the same time, increased diversity is what the Utah Republican party needs as it looks to the future, Cannon said. “We need to have a diversity of voices at the table because we are losing that demographic at the Republican Party.” Stewart Peay Peay, 47, a lawyer who lives in Alpine, was elected as chairman of the Utah County GOP in April 2019. By day, Peay works as a partner at Snell & Wilmer, where he’s worked for 18 years. He also served in the Utah National Guard for 13 years, including a tour in Iraq. Stewart Peay Stewart Peay In his two years as Utah County GOP chairman, Peay said he spent that time “unifying Utah County Republicans, which is no small task.” When he first came to the post, Peay said the county Republicans couldn’t get along to make decisions at the executive committee level, and he attributed that as a big reason why Love lost to McAdams in 2018. Last year, Peay said the Utah County GOP energized more voters and helped push Owens to victory. “One of the key things I did in Utah County is listen to everybody,” Peay said. “I encourage all parties to bring forward their positions, then as a leadership group we figure out a resolution that works for our party. It’s not perfect for everyone, but it’s great for the party, and that’s what we need.” The emerging blue sea around Utah in the West, the changing political landscape and the threat it poses to Republicans’ future in Utah is “why I’m running” for the statewide party chairperson position. During the past two years, Peay credited Miller for “getting the party back on track, and I feel like we need to stay on that track if we’re going to defend our traditional Republican values and strongholds here in Utah.” As Utah’s population changes and as more people move in from states like California, Peay said the Utah Republican Party needs to “control its message.” “We need to explain there is so much great economic opportunity here in Utah because for 40 years the Utah Republican Party has dominated state and local politics,” Peay said. “We need to educate people about that and help them understand that if we keep Utah Republican, those same opportunities will still be here for our children and even our grandchildren.” Cox, Henderson, legislative leaders including House Speaker Brad Wilson and Senate President Stuart Adams, and others endorsed Peay in a letter circulated to delegates, mailed using the Utah Republican Party’s indicia — a service that’s offered to all Utah GOP candidates for cheaper postage. Peay said those endorsements show he knows how to “build a team.” “And that’s what we plan to do,” he said, along with his vice chairperson running mate Austin Cox. He says he plans to do that with a unifying style. “The role of state party leadership is to build a bigger tent. It’s not to divide. It’s not to offend. Rather, it’s to build a team and to get that team to coalesce around the ideas and values of the Republican Party.” Carson Jorgensen Jorgensen, 31, of Mount Pleasant in Sanpete County, is a sixth-generation sheep rancher in a family that’s lived in Utah for more than 150 years, he said. His family businesses are Skyline Sheep Co., as well as Skyline Bit and Spur, a small business that ships horse bridles and silver. Carson Jorgensen Carson Jorgensen His family’s heritage, Jorgensen said, tells the story of “why this race is important to me.” “We rely heavily on public lands,” he said, describing how the sheep industry helped build Utah’s infrastructure. So that’s why he’s getting involved in politics, he said. “Unfortunately, politics shapes a lot of these things,” he said. “Politics is getting increasingly militant around agriculture, and if we don’t start taking a key role in policy, agriculture is going to be one that is going to lose out big time, especially here in Utah where 75% of the state is federal land and most of it is used for agriculture.” Jorgensen pointed to Biden’s “30 by 30” climate change policy and said “it’s going to drastically affect the agriculture sector here in Utah and it’s going to ruin the legacy of my family.” So, Jorgensen said he wants to get involved to save the future of agriculture and public lands in Utah. “I don’t want to see the history of Utahns thrown under the bus for progressive policy,” he said. It’s not the first time Jorgensen has stepped into politics. Last year, he sent a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence, members of Congress and others detailing the impacts to sheep ranching of the acquisition of a Colorado lamb processing facility, which led to an investigation. Jorgensen also ran an unsuccessful bid against Rep. Chris Stewart last year. On his campaign website, Jorgensen discusses “expanding the tent” in Utah’s GOP, in order to attract new voters, especially young voters. He also prioritizes strengthening rural Utah, including wildfire mitigation, outdoor recreation, water quality, food supply chain and more to “bridge the urban and rural divide.” Jorgensen also states Utah’s GOP must “tackle the issue” of SB54 and strengthen the party’s convention system. Brad Baker Baker, 22, a Weber State University student who lives in Sunset, said one of the biggest reasons why he’s decided to get involved is because he’s sick of the “mudslinging, backstabbing” that’s gone on at the national level. “I firmly believe that’s not what being a Republican is about,” Baker said. “I would argue it’s something that both sides are guilty of, and as such the biggest thing we need as a party but as the state of Utah as a whole is more unity and more hope for the future.” Baker acknowledges that he does not have as much political experience as his opponents, but he argued he’s the “best equipped candidate” to make the party more appealing to younger voters and therefore secure the party’s future. “We also need to have more voices in the room from a wider variety of backgrounds, a wider variety of life experiences because how goes the Republican Party, so goes the state of Utah,” he said. “By voting for me, the delegates would get a candidate who is emphasizing unity, emphasizing greater diversity in encouraging people to run who might not otherwise.” Baker said he would expand the party’s accessibility by modernizing the party’s tactics through use of social media and technology, make sure caucus nights are better advertised so younger Utahns would know how to get involved, and consider moving caucus night to the weekend to help make it more accessible to those who work during the week.\n",

      "Gold Forecast: Hovering Between Moving Averages. Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then I believe that gold should do fairly well. Gold markets initially tried to rally during the course of the trading session on Thursday but failed to continue going higher at the 200 day EMA as it continues to be quite resistive. At this point, the market then felt to reach down below the 50 day EMA, which of course was a very negative sign. However, by the end of the session we turned around to break above the 50 day EMA and now it looks like the market is essentially doing the same thing it has been doing for several days. These are two major averages that a lot of people pay attention to, so it should not be overly surprising that we are stuck in this general vicinity. Furthermore, you have to pay close attention to the US dollar, because the gold market is highly influenced by it. Now that that we have broken down below the 50 day EMA, it looks like the market is finding value hunters underneath just above the $1750 level. I think what we are looking at here is a market that is trying to figure out where we are getting ready to go longer term. When you look at the charts you can see that we have formed a double bottom just below the $1700 level, so I think if we break down below the $1750 level, then we will go testing that area. However, the $1750 level above had been resisted previously, broken out above, and now has been retested. At this point, we have to question whether or not this attempt to form a basing pattern has started to stick? A break above the $1800 level opens up the possibility of a much bigger move, and therefore I think that is the key for buying this market. Until then, I would be hesitant to put a lot of money into the gold market, but it certainly looks as if we are trying to turn things around. It could be very noisy over the next couple of weeks, but I do have my eye on this market as a confirmation of the return could very well send this market looking towards the highs again. Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then I believe that gold should do fairly well.\n",

      "Many departments have made heavy blows to crack down on the transmission of movie pirates in theaters. The cultural industry is booming, and it is difficult to hide its light under the haze of the epidemic. The total box office of the Spring Festival stalls in 2021 will exceed 7.8 billion yuan, setting a new box office record for the Spring Festival stalls in China. Among them, the box office of &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; rushed to 5.4 billion and 4.5 billion yuan respectively, and currently ranks second and fifth in China&#39;s total box office. Behind the impressive achievements are the dedication of relevant law enforcement agencies in cracking down on piracy and their hard work in impartial law enforcement. While we are enjoying the excellent content quality, sophisticated production level, and fascinating plot in the movie theater, a thunder action aimed at regulating the copyright order of the film market is underway. This is the centralized action against the spread of movie pirates in theaters jointly deployed by the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, and the Food and Drug Crime Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. During the concentrated operation from February to March, the local copyright and film authorities focused their inspections on the screening and dissemination of 7 Spring Festival movie theaters, dispatched more than 36,500 law enforcement officers, and inspected 11,800 theaters and on-demand theaters. , Inspected 2,682 websites. This action was fruitful and effectively curbed the spread of movie pirated recordings in theaters. Actions to protect copyright and encourage creation continue. What is certain is that the prosperous and healthy development of the film industry can be expected in the future. Investigating and handling many major cases. The Spring Festival file this year was unexpectedly good-high-quality content aggregated delivery, innovative and flexible marketing methods, and the pre-sale stage was the first to win. &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot;, &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot;, &quot;Assassination of Novelists&quot;, &quot;Samurai Order&quot;, &quot;Surge of Crowds&quot;, &quot;New God List: Nezha Rebirth&quot;, &quot;Bear Infested Wild Continent&quot;, these 7 films are competing The box office &quot;main track&quot; shines on the road. Rao Shuguang, president of the Chinese Film Critics Society, commented that the Spring Festival films have improved and made breakthroughs in genre and aesthetic expression, demonstrating the strong resilience and vitality of the Chinese film market. Good content brings good word of mouth. While attracting audiences to enter the theater, Spring Festival movies are also targeted by criminals. When the Spring Festival movie continued to be popular, some netizens discovered that pirated resources had appeared on the Internet. Such problems have also been monitored by the regulatory authorities, and many cases have subsequently surfaced. For example, in the case of “February 19” pirating and disseminating cinematic movies during the Spring Festival in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, according to the monitoring clues of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, the Food and Drug Crime Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, and the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, the police of Jinhua City, Zhejiang The agency, together with the copyright department, successfully solved the case, arrested 19 criminal suspects, seized pirated versions of &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Chinatown Detective 3&quot; and many other cinema-line movies during the Spring Festival, and eliminated the main source of cinema pirates and seized them. There are 17 criminal equipment, realizing the full-chain crackdown on offline recording and online dissemination. According to investigations, since December 2020, the suspect Zhou and Mao have repeatedly pirated cinema-line movies in theaters in Zhengzhou, Anyang, Henan Province and other places. After video editing, they made high-definition pirated movies for their own business. Movie bars play for profit, and sell them through WeChat, cloud disk, etc., and then resell them through the Internet layer by layer when they are offline, or build websites to spread illegally. In another case, in order to attract and maintain customers, the micro-business Chen XX pirated the Spring Festival cinema movies such as &quot;The Crowd&quot; and &quot;Assassination of Novelists&quot; in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province in cooperation with Zhou. Chen XX uploaded the pirated videos to Internet disk, and send the Internet disk link to his WeChat friends, triggering network transmission. According to the monitoring clues of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department and the Film Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, the copyright department of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province investigated the case. In March this year, the Public Security Bureau of Yibin City, Sichuan Province resolved the case based on clues handed over by the Municipal Press and Publication Bureau, arrested 18 suspects, and seized a large number of pirated CDs and USB flash drives, involving &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; &quot;The Crowd&quot;, &quot;The Order of the God of Servant&quot; and many other cinema movies and other films and music works during the Spring Festival. After investigation, since 2011, Zhu and others have purchased a large number of U disks, CDs, and SD cards that store infringing audio-visual products from criminals in Guangdong and other places, copied them and sold them to the outside world. Still in March, the Public Security Bureau of Dengzhou City, Henan Province successfully solved the case based on clues discovered by the Mopai, arrested 31 suspects, seized 29 servers and playback devices (sets), including &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; and other Spring Festival files Many movie works including theater movies. After investigation, Zhai and others established an on-demand theater company to obtain pirated movie resources from the Internet, import their theater-on-demand system into a basic movie library, play in the on-demand movie theaters they operate, and sell their basic movie library to multi-location movie theaters. Behind the early warning and rapid handling of many typical cases is the result of the joint deployment of multiple departments to carry out centralized operations to combat the transmission of movie pirates in theaters, and the adoption of a variety of effective measures to severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities in the transmission of movie pirates in theaters during the Spring Festival. Early warning protection for film copyrights was deployed before the Spring Festival. On February 8, the National Copyright Administration released the second batch of key works copyright protection early warning list for 2021, and included 7 Chinese New Year movie theaters including &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; into the early warning protection, requiring the provision of content, storage, search links, and electricity. Various network service providers such as commercial websites and application stores have taken effective measures to prevent and deal with infringement and piracy such as pirated recordings and transmission of cinema movies in a timely manner. At the same time, local copyright and film authorities have strengthened the management of movie theaters, strictly guarded against secret photography and recording, and increased network inspections and piracy monitoring. According to Tang Zhaozhi, the person in charge of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, during the concentrated operation, the local copyright and film authorities focused their inspections on the screening and dissemination of 7 Spring Festival movie theaters, and dispatched more than 36,500 law enforcement personnel to inspect theaters and on-demand. There were 11,800 theaters and other places, and 2,682 website inspections. &quot;Monitoring results show that there is no phenomenon of infringement and piracy of movies on the Spring Festival file on regular video websites. Pirated content and links are mostly spread illegally through social platforms, online disks, e-commerce platforms, and undocumented small websites of the&#39;Three Nothings&#39;, and most of them The server of the &quot;Three Nothing&quot; website is located outside the country.&quot; Tang Zhaozhi said. Fast handling of infringement is also an important part of copyright protection. According to Tang Zhaozhi, the local copyright and film authorities have arranged multiple shifts and multiple lines to respond, carefully screening and systematically sorting out the complaints of rights holders and the information reported by the masses, and supervising all network service providers to take emergency measures to quickly delete the archives related to the Spring Festival. There are more than 30,000 infringing links to online movies. Including the aforementioned cases, local copyright and film authorities and public security organs investigate and handle major cases. Strengthen clue finding, actively expand the source of the case, investigate and lock a number of suspects who were photographed and pirated, and the public security organs will launch criminal investigations, pursue criminal responsibility for criminals in accordance with the law, and promote the investigation and handling of cases to trace the source, destroy gangs, and destroy the Internet. It is understood that, at present, 39 key cases involving movie infringement and piracy have been investigated and dealt with in various places, and 45 infringing websites have been closed, effectively curbing the momentum of the spread of movie piracy in movie theaters. The efforts to dig and protect excellent IP to combat piracy will continue to increase. Tang Zhaozhi revealed that in the next step, local law enforcement agencies will dig deeper into the source of piracy, increase efforts to crack down on sneak shots and pirated recordings in theaters, severely investigate and punish websites, WeChat public accounts, and e-commerce operators that sell and disseminate pirated films, and urge all online platforms to strengthen their corporate bodies. Responsibilities and severe penalties for pirating and disseminating cinema-line movies that have strong opinions and great social harm to the rights holders, create a good social atmosphere that respects copyright and creation, and promotes the prosperity and healthy development of the film industry. It is worth noting that the recent protection of the copyright of film works is also reflected in the move to increase the crackdown on infringements in the field of short videos. Yu Cike, director of the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department, said that this year the National Copyright Administration will continue to intensify its crackdown on infringements in the field of short videos, and resolutely rectify short video platforms and unauthorized copying and performances by producers and operators of self-media and public accounts. , Spread the infringement of other people&#39;s films, music and other works. Promote short video platforms, self-media, and public account operators to fully perform their main responsibilities, effectively strengthen the construction of the copyright system, improve the copyright complaint handling mechanism, and effectively perform the obligation of reporting on illegal and criminal clues and cooperating in investigations. Encourage and support film copyright collective management organizations to strengthen their own construction, carry out collective management of film copyrights in accordance with the law, and play a good role in safeguarding the legal rights of rights holders and facilitating the legal use of users. On the one hand, we will not be merciless to infringers, and on the other hand, we will encourage excellent works. Recently, the first &quot;China Annual IP Selection&quot; aimed at telling the Chinese story, encouraging integrity and innovation, strengthening protection, promoting transformation, and mining China&#39;s good IP was announced. The selection activity is guided by the Copyright Administration of the Central Propaganda Department and hosted by the National Copyright Exchange Center Alliance. Film and television originals occupy a place among the top ten tracks set by it to find outstanding representatives of Chinese cultural copyright in various fields. &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; won the gold award, &quot;The Great Sister&quot; and &quot;Su Mang&#39;s Covenant&quot; won the silver award, &quot;Assassination of the Novelist&quot; won the bronze award, and &quot;Hello, Li Huanying&quot; won the promotion award. Li Heng, chairman of the China National Copyright Exchange, said that under the current background that the country attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights, it is necessary to make great efforts to promote the changes in the content, market, and concepts of the cultural industry to effectively promote the inheritance, innovation and development of culture. Achieve diversity and diversified cultural transmission, promote deeper and broader cultural exchanges such as spiritual and material; and in various tracks in the cultural field, excavate outstanding local Chinese IP, protect copyright from being stolen and changed in circulation, and retain artistic and cultural characteristics , To better promote cultural and artistic exchanges and prosperity.

World share indices extended gains and Treasury yields rose on Thursday, after strong U.S. economic data and the Federal Reserve's commitment to continue supporting the economy fueled confidence in a recovery.U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, fueled by massive government aid to households and businesses, charting the course for what is expected will be the strongest annual performance in nearly four decades.\"Assuming that COVID variants remain contained, the second quarter is set for a further acceleration in growth as the re-openings continue,\" said Katherine Judge, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.New York City aims to \"fully reopen\" on July 1 after more than a year of closures and capacity restrictions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33%, closing at an all-time high and remaining on course for its best month since November.The S&P 500 also closed at a record high.

      "Gold-standard' swab tests will cost holidaymakers just £45 each. Holidaymakers will be able to get a Covid test for just £45 under government plans to make holidays abroad more affordable when international travel opens up. The PCR tests, which are required on entry by most European countries, would be provided for a fraction of the current price if the government's plan goes ahead, the transport secretary said. 'Gold standard' PCR swab tests will continue to be required for all travellers arriving in Britain, despite the Prime Minister previously suggesting that rapid lateral flow tests could be considered for use. The news of cheaper tests for holidaymakers comes three weeks after  Boris Johnson asked officials to consider using the on-the-spot rapid tests to make the tests more affordable, stating that the  reopening the holiday market from May 17 was a 'priority'.     Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced the news on Thursday that 'a new entrant' had made it possible to supply PCR tests for £44.40. Currently anyone coming to the UK has to take a pre-flight test and buy a two-swab package to be used two and eight days after arrival.  Official packages use gold-standard PCR technology and cost around £200 a head, this is due to fall to £45 by May 17 when some international travel is set to resume. Shapps told the Commons: 'I know that the House is interested on the update with regard to travel returning internationally and I wanted to provide a very quick update to say that although PCR tests may be required from a medical, scientific point of view, we have been working with private laboratories, pharmacies, supermarkets and other companies to encourage them to deliver on their logistical expertise and enter the market and drive down the cost. 'We've seen some success so far because the cost of a single PCR day two test now has come down to £60 from one of the large providers on the government-linked site, with a new entrant now at £44.90, enabling more people to access PCR tests as international travel returns.' The drop in price brings hope to the millions of Britons desperate for a foreign holiday after months of lockdown.  In other good news British tourists will be welcome in France from June 9 as long as they have proof of vaccination or a negative test. The announcement by president Emmanuel Macron comes as a study finds much of Europe could safely be put on the travel 'green list' this summer. The list could include up to 24 countries, The Times reports. Mr Macron's announcement will pile further pressure on ministers to restart foreign holidays to major hotspots for sun-starved Britons. Under France's reopening, restrictions on cafes and restaurants will be lifted gradually with a return to near-normal by June 30. The Yale University research showed restarting quarantine-free travel to popular destinations such as Spain, Portugal and Greece would not increase infection rates. And hospitalisations would only increase by about six a day if travel was restarted with up to 31 European countries. There are currently around 124 daily hospitalisations in England. Johan Lundgren, boss of easyJet which commissioned the study, said: 'Based on the results of this ground-breaking research, and applying the principles set out in the roadmap set out by the Prime Minister, easyJet can demonstrate that it is safe to put much of Europe on the green list. 'This is because the analysis not only shows that travel from several European countries, including popular holiday destinations like Spain, Portugal and Greece, would not affect the UK case rate. 'But even more importantly, that travel to and from Europe would have very little impact on hospitalisations in the UK.' He stressed that countries with worrying new variants should remain subject to strict measures such as quarantine. The study is due to be submitted for peer review shortly. Countries' ratings as green, amber and red will be set out by May 10.      \n",

      "Westminster redecorating could paint Johnson into a corner. The writer, a former head of the Downing Street policy unit, is a Harvard senior fellowBritish politics currently resembles a whodunnit, with Westminster consumed by one question: who paid to redecorate the prime minister’s Downing Street flat? Boris Johnson will not be brought down by wallpaper-gate: voters didn’t foot the bill, and are looking forward to the summer, thanks to his swift vaccine rollout. But if the impression keeps growing that Britain is run by a gilded chumocracy, it could prove toxic at the next election.It may seem odd that a domestic makeover has achieved such prominence. It’s partly because it is the latest in a series of allegations, including that ministers offered Covid contracts to friends and helped a Tory donor win a lucrative planning permission. In the early stages of the pandemic, it was understandable that urgency sometimes trumped due diligence, but there is now a feeling that too many affairs of state are being treated with casual informality. The Electoral Commission seems to believe that the prime minister may have broken the law. Although Johnson insists he has settled the £58,000 bill for the flat, he has not denied that it was originally paid for by the Conservative party, through a loan or donation, neither of which were declared. The dramatic cast of characters makes it impossible to kill the story. The poisonous Rasputin Dominic Cummings, ousted as chief of staff, is preparing a dossier of wounding information for a parliamentary committee. Ben Elliot, the Duchess of Cornwall’s nephew, was party co-chairman when a gift of £15,000 to the party from businessman Lord Brownlow was declared to the Electoral Commission; a second gift of £58,000 was not. Meanwhile the first fiancée, Carrie Symonds, whose choice of gold wallpaper supposedly sent the prime minister into paroxysms, has been dubbed Carrie Antoinette.The most damaging aspect may prove to be not the cover-up, but the snub to a national treasure, the John Lewis department store. Tatler magazine quoted unnamed friends of Symonds complaining that Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May had created a “John Lewis furniture nightmare”. The commissioning of “eco-designer” Lulu Lytle, whose colourful prints fill grand houses from Barbados to Park Avenue, feels like an extravagance which is especially jarring, given Symonds’ supposed environmentalism. Lytle may lace her curtains with seaweed, but there’s nothing “eco” about chucking out a two-year old sofa. The taxpayer will not be footing the bill — unlike the grants given to Johnson’s girlfriend Jennifer Arcuri when he was mayor of London, or the huge sums spent on test and trace. The problem is that it seems to cast the prime minister in a new light, as a man who cares about appearances, rather than the messy-haired rogue we thought we knew. Central to Boris Johnson’s charm is that he has always looked a shambles, lived off pizza, ridden rickety bikes, enjoyed a good boogie on the dance floor, and not given a damn. He has always worried about money, but mainly to support his children from official and unofficial dalliances. His mistakes and lack of pretension have made him human, in an age of robotic politicians.To diss John Lewis, however, is to attack an institution which has served Middle England from cradle to grave. Many of us got our school uniforms there, we had our wedding lists there, and we still buy presents for granny there, knowing she can always return them with no fuss. Its genius is to be faintly upmarket but not flashy: as voters might once have seen Boris. British prime ministers are unusual in having to live above the shop in pretty modest circumstances. Most opt for the four-bedroom flat above Number 11 Downing Street, and let their chancellor use the smaller one above Number 10. When you work in the building, you get used to bumping into the country’s leaders on the back stairs, and seeing their children playing in the garden. The Elysée Palace or the White House it ain’t — I used to take my turn with the policemen for the only shower-room — but it supports our belief that we are a sober nation of principle. At Chequers, the prime minister’s country house, I was once told approvingly by staff that Gordon Brown was so parsimonious that he had refused to light the log fires. There is actually a strong argument for the state to do more to maintain these official buildings. But it was cack-handed to have tried to create a Downing Street Trust to fund improvements which might in turn have saved Johnson from having to cough up. Next week’s local elections will show whether the public has noticed any of this. I suspect they won’t. Johnson has a strong poll lead and a large majority. The risk is that the drip-drip of sleaze allegations will slowly corrode this government just as it doomed John Major’s in the 1990s, when a minister was jailed for perjury, and some MPs took “cash for questions”. It felt then as though the Tories had been in power too long. Could “cash for curtains” create a similar ennui?John Lewis’s legendary slogan is “never knowingly undersold”. I would add: never knowingly underestimate Boris Johnson. But if he doesn’t come clean, and if this wasn’t the only loan, this may prove to have been the moment he painted himself into a corner.\n",

      "First observation | These words of the general secretary are not just to say one time and one place. In the past few days, General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Guangxi and gave important instructions on the construction of ecological civilization along the way. Many golden sentences have been brushed off the screen. At almost the same time, the Central Ecological Environmental Protection Inspectorate in eight provinces and autonomous regions notified many typical cases of destroying the ecological environment. It is thought-provoking to link these two things together. On the Lijiang River, General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to a report on the comprehensive management of the river basin. In recent years, Guilin City has vigorously promoted the Lijiang River to &quot;control chaos, water, mountains, and root causes&quot; to improve the ecological environment of the Lijiang River. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Hongshe general secretary emphasized, “The worst thing is quarrying. If you destroy a mountain, you will lose such a mountain forever. The whole of China and the world is such a treasure. Don’t destroy it.” Central Ecological Environment Among the typical cases just exposed by the protection inspection team, there are several cases of illegal quarrying and mining. In some places, illegal quarrying is still carried out in the World Geopark Reserve, which has caused serious ecological damage. This time, the general secretary pointed out the quarrying problem straightforwardly, which is very realistic for some places. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, whether it is for domestic investigations and investigations or attending international events, wherever General Secretary Xi Jinping goes, he has talked about the concept that green waters and green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains. However, some phenomena that seriously damage the ecology and seriously pollute the environment are still exposed from time to time. What is the problem behind this? Some local leading cadres believe that the region has a good ecological background, large environmental capacity, a little sewage, a little tree cut, and a little project &quot;innocent&quot;, and they lack understanding of the urgency of ecological environmental protection. The concept of &quot;emphasizing development and neglecting protection&quot; of some local leading cadres has not been fundamentally reversed, and the phenomenon that ecological environmental protection is &quot;important when it comes to it, but secondary when it is done&quot; still occurs from time to time. There are also historical reasons that some local leading cadres &quot;should the pot&quot;, and the ability and level of governance to implement the new development concept still needs to be improved. &quot;Any abuse of mining and digging requires not only accountability, but also criminal responsibility in accordance with the law.&quot; Regarding the chaos of quarrying, the general secretary&#39;s words were very serious, and once again sounded the alarm for the ecological and environmental protection of various places. In fact, this is also the consistent attitude of the Party Central Committee towards ecological and environmental issues. The illegal construction of villas in Qinling Mountains destroys the ecological environment. General Secretary Xi Jinping has issued important instructions 6 times to solve the problems personally; local ecological damage in the Qilian Mountains, pollution incident in the Tengger Desert, illegal filling of the Qiandao Lake... Grasp the problem of destruction to the end. There is a phenomenon that is particularly noteworthy. In the past few days, the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team has exposed many typical cases of blindly expanding production capacity and launching projects regardless of resource endowments-Shanxi Jinzhong City has not approved the first construction and launched five large-scale coking projects in violation of regulations. Enterprises illegally discharged pollutants and competed with the people for water, causing difficulties for nearby residents. The construction of chemical and coal power projects in Guzhen County, Anhui illegally started construction, and the bottom line of regional environmental quality has been repeatedly breached, posing a threat to the water ecological environment of the Huaihe River... In the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, after experiencing the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and facing the external environment of headwinds and currents, the enthusiasm for development projects in some places began to swell, and they wanted to pursue a &quot;good start.&quot; The Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Supervisor is approved by the Party Central Committee. At the beginning of the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot;, this inspection was organized, and the strict control of high energy-consuming and high-emission projects was blindly launched as one of the inspection priorities, which was very targeted. Coincidentally, 5 years ago, the &quot;13th Five-Year Plan&quot; started. Before that, in 2015, China&#39;s economic growth continued to slow down, falling below 7%. Some provinces and cities along the Yangtze River are gearing up for projects in the 13th Five-Year Plan. On January 5, 2016, General Secretary Xi Jinping convened a symposium on promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in Chongqing, and he eloquently proposed “to protect together, and not to develop”. &quot;It seems to be a pot of cold water.&quot; This symposium promptly cooled the development impulse of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River, and it was a reversal of the direction of economic development. In the past five years, the General Secretary hosted three symposiums around the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt to consolidate the path of ecological priority and green development. Practice has proved that the joint efforts to protect the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River not only did not affect the development speed of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River, but also greatly enhanced the supporting and leading role of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in supporting the high-quality development of the country. Looking at the first year in five years, getting started is critical. The &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; is a critical period and window period for carbon peaks. Once the “two highs” project blindly launched, it will not only damage the current ecological environment, but also pose a severe challenge to the future carbon dioxide emission reduction and the achievement of carbon peak and carbon neutral commitments. It is very necessary to press down on such signs from the beginning. Combining this background, and looking at the words of the General Secretary during this Guangxi inspection, we can bring out more profound meaning-&quot;adhere to the correct ecological concept and development concept&quot;; &quot;maintain the authenticity and integrity of the landscape ecology as an important &quot;Work&quot;; &quot;Incorporate carbon peaking and carbon neutrality into the overall layout of economic and social development and ecological civilization construction&quot;; &quot;Promote a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development&quot;; &quot;Come on a path of high-quality development that conforms to local realities&quot;... This It was spoken to Guangxi, and it was spoken to the whole country. A good start, a good start. The alarm bells must be ringing forever in all places, and the trend of destroying the ecological environment in exchange for economic development at a time, insisting on ecological priority and promoting high-quality development can create a high-quality and happy life for the people.

The speculations about Anushka’s wedding had been doing rounds for a very long time. Being Tollywood's most eligible lady bachelor, the movie world has been looking forward to the wedding of Anushka. Moreover, she has been staying away from the silver screen in the recent past. If reports are to be believed, Anushka Shetty is all set to tie the knot with a Dubai-based businessman . The actress’ parents have been focusing on her marriage for a long time. Now, Anushka is said to have given the green signal by insisting that she should get married without any further delay. With this, her parents started the hunt for the perfect pair for Anushka. It is being said that Anushka’s to-be-marriage is arranged one. However, no confirmation has been made by the actress or her spokesperson yet. This is not the first time that the news about her wedding has been doing the rounds. After Baahubali , it was rumoured that Anushka was dating pan-India star Prabhas and her marriage with him was also confirmed. Both Prabhas and Anushka denied the news, and it came to a full stop. Again, a new rumour has surfaced that Anushka was getting married to a team India cricketer but, that too is not true.\n",

      "Full FDA approval of Covid-19 vaccines could help fight vaccine hesitancy, officials say. (CNN)As a condition of the emergency use authorizations issued for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines, those companies are expected to work toward asking the US Food and Drug Administration for full approval -- and some health officials are hoping it will happen soon. Dr. Sanjay Gupta looks into the origins of vaccine hesitancy Dr. Fauci explains importance of vaccine approval process What medical professionals are doing to fight vaccine hesitancy These vaccines have been in use since mid-December under emergency use authorizations, known as EUAs. During the pandemic, real-world data have shown the vaccines are against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Wednesday he hopes Covid-19 vaccines will receive full FDA approval \"very soon,\" and that the FDA will work \"as expeditiously as possible\" on approval applications for coronavirus vaccines as they come in. Progressing from authorized to approved would allow manufacturers to market and directly distribute their vaccines. It could also have an impact on vaccine mandates -- and perhaps sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now. The road to FDA approval Currently, the three Covid-19 vaccines distributed in the United States -- made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- are authorized, but not approved. Due to the seriousness of the pandemic, vaccine makers originally applied for EUAs because the authorization process takes less time than what would be required for full approval. Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests -- a medical product, such as a vaccine, that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency. When the health emergency is over, \"then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,\" according to the FDA. So, vaccine makers will have to file a separate application for vaccines to be fully licensed. CNN has contacted Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- the most recent Covid-19 vaccine to be authorized -- about their plans to apply for full approval of their vaccines. None provided a timeline. The typical approval process for vaccine developers requires completing lab research, pre-clinical testing and Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials in humans. That has already been done for these coronavirus vaccines. The FDA also requires vaccine manufacturers to submit data to support their manufacturing processes, facilities, product characterization and demonstration that the vaccine can be produced reliably and consistently. Once all of that is complete -- both the clinical trials and manufacturing details -- companies can submit a Biologics License Application or BLA to the FDA. \"By submitting a BLA to the FDA, a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine for use in the United States,\" according to the FDA's website. \"FDA evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and ness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency. After its evaluation, FDA decides whether to approve (also known as to license) the vaccine for use in the United States.\" Applications designated as \"priority review\" mean the FDA's goal is to take action on an application within six months. A \"standard review\" could take longer. \"When you're getting a formal approval you have to have a certain amount of time just observing predominantly the safety -- and obviously the safety looks really, really good in well over 140 million people having been vaccinated with at least a single dose,\" Fauci said on CNN on Wednesday. After all, as spread of the virus is reduced, the nation may no longer be under an emergency situation and the vaccines will need a different type of green light under the FDA. The agency is \"the gold standard of a safety and regulatory organization throughout the world,\" said Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden. \"I hope they do it quickly.\" 'It will help show skeptics that the authorized Covid vaccines are safe' A concern around authorized-but-unapproved vaccines hinges on vaccine hesitancy. If history is any indication, skepticism -- if not outright mistrust -- about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new. One study published in 2009, months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 influenza and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, researchers explored the public's willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an EUA -- not full FDA approval -- by surveying a representative sample of more than 1,500 US adults. The researchers, from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Georgia, found that about 77% of respondents would be moderately, very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine; some 63% said they would not take it. But the study also found that there were some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an EUA was safe to use. If the vaccine were administered by a public health professional, 55% of respondents said they would take it. If it came with a fact sheet, just over 57% of those surveyed said they would get it. If their own health care provider administered the vaccine, that number shot up to 68%. Dr. Jerome Adams, US surgeon general during the Trump administration, wrote in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post on Tuesday that approval will help show skeptics that the authorized coronavirus vaccines are safe. \"We should also pursue full Food and Drug Administration approval and expand covid vaccinations to youths,\" Adams wrote in part. \"The individuals who got vaccinated early on were generally high risk and willing to take a vaccine authorized for emergency use. But many people who are lower risk understandably ask if the benefits justify taking a medication that has not received the full and traditional FDA stamp of approval,\" he wrote. \"As vaccine manufacturers complete further studies, which will eventually lead to expanded eligibility among minors, it will help show skeptics that the authorized covid vaccines are safe.\" Plans to require vaccines Some organizations say they expect to require the vaccine, but have opted not to while it's authorized and not yet fully approved. \"People, when they hear it's still emergency use, they still have a little concern about how far you can go with it,\" Fauci said on CNN Wednesday. The University of California and California State University systems announced last week that their universities intend to require faculty, staff and students to be vaccinated against the coronavirus -- but the requirement would go into effect only once a vaccine has received full FDA approval. The proposed policy would begin this fall. The California State University noted in its announcement, \"This requirement will become at the beginning of the fall 2021 term, or upon full FDA approval of the vaccine, whichever occurs later.\"\n",

      "VELCAN HOLDINGS : Annual results 2020 - stable financial results but decrease of the net income. t PRESS RELEASE Luxembourg, 30 th  April 2021 : ANNUAL RESULTS 20 20 STABLE FINANCIAL RESULTS  BUT DECREASE OF THE NET INCOME DUE TO DISAPPOINTING OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA  NON AUDITED KEY CONSOLIDATED FIGURES 20 20 201 9 Var % Revenues (EUR m) 2. 5 2. 8 -12 % EBITDA (EUR m) - 2.0 -1. 4 -4 5% Net Income (EUR m) 2. 1 3 . 6 -4 1 % Shareholders’ Equity (EUR m) 1 16 1 21 -4 % Cash and Financial assets 10 5 103 +1 %  closed 2020 with a net result, Group share, of EUR 2.1m compared to EUR 3.6m in 2019. This decline essentially stems from, on one hand a drop of the Brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the Indian projects, leading to an overall decline of the result. The EBITDA is also down by 45% ( EUR -2.0m in 2020 vs EUR -1.4 m in 2019). Net financial gains, which amounted to EUR 7.7m , were almost stable compared to EUR 8.1m in 2019, mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities. Shareholder’s equity decreased by 4% mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 (492 k shares bought back in 2020, for a total price of EUR 3.1m ). During 2020, the  continued developing its hydropower concessions located in India (571 MW), and operated its Rodeio Bonito hydropower plant (15 MW) in Brazil . The uncertainties and deadlocks of the Indian hydropower market remained, as in 2019, and prevented progress of the projects, leading to an additional provision or Eur 2.8 million (20%) for FY 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects. This brought the total provision to Eur 7.1 million (50%), considering the previously booked provisions. This additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in October 2020 . The Rodeio Bonito plant generation was historically low, 40% below the 2019 generation, as a result of the severe draught in the south of Brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the MRE system 1 . At constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown (+18%) thanks to the inflation of selling prices. In Euro the turnover is down by 12% ( EUR 2.5 m in 2020 vs EUR 2.8 m in 2019) because of the massive depreciation of the Brazilian currency in 2020 (-41%). FINANCIAL YEAR 20 20 – MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE BUSINESS India The hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the State of Arunachal Pradesh could not make significant progress, due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments, aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Techno-Economic Clearance (TEC), Environmental Clearance, Forest Clearance as well as most of the post TEC investigations being complete for the tandem Heo-Tato-1 (426 MW), the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition, the transport infrastructure, the amendment of the concession agreements, the stage 2 Forest Clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). These steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the State and Central Governments. During 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the State Government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the District administration to enter some parts of the land, complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations. The discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in February 2020 were suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak, as the required meetings could happen only physically. The procedure could restart only in February 2021 . All the on-site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the  in March 2021 , without interruption. As of the date of this press release, the Group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the . However the Group’s team attended each survey and it is the Group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the  as being under ownership dispute, and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the State Government. The Group does not know yet if and how the Government of Arunachal Pradesh (GoAP) will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the Projects’ implementation. considers that, as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations, the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing Government. The concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer. Negotiations with the GoAP, for the amendment of the concession agreement, relate to the development timeframe, but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities (still 380MW in the current concession agreement) and other important terms, have not progressed since 2018. This has led to the impossibility to renew the TECs of the Heo and Tato-1 (426 MW) tandem in 2020, as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 MW capacity approved by CEA, or a non-objection certificate (NOC) from the GoAP. TECs of Heo and Tato-1 HEP, granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years, were bearing validities until on 27 th  July 2020 and 28 th  October 2020 respectively. Applications for renewals of both TECs were submitted to CEA, which requested the Group to obtain from GoAP a (NOC) acknowledging that the GoAP has no objection to the renewal of the projects TECs for the current capacities of 240 MW and 186 MW. After several discussions the GoAP refused, on 1 st  October 2020 , to issue a NOC unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs, some of which the Group does not agree with. After requesting a draft amendment to the GoAP during Q4 2020, without success, the Group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in Q1 2021. Its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities, the administrative fees, the development timeframe, the obligations of both parties, and the increase of the free power to the GoAP against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects. The provisions have been proposed by the Group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the Indian hydropower market. As of the date of this press release, the discussions are going on with the GoAP, but both TECs of Heo and Tato-1 HEP are technically not valid anymore, and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement (in addition to the CEA renewal procedure). The road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years. No progress has been made by the  regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule. The scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022, but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed. On the forest clearance side, the renewal of the stage-I clearance has been applied for in September 2020 and is still under progress as of date. The Group continued to explore the Indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a PPA during 2020. All the major Indian power traders (PPA brokers) and distribution companies (DISCOMS) contacted for Heo and Tato-1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a PPA or did not respond. The continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower PPAs results from the commercial and financial Indian market conditions, which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower. The market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable PPAs, the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies (DISCOMS) and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power. Grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for Run-of-the-River (ROR, hence with no storage) hydro projects such as Heo and Tato-1 HEPs. Two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the , a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued, imposing a Hydropower Purchase Obligation (HPO) on DISCOMS, setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030. These percentages range from 0.18% to 2.82% and are remarkably lower than those of solar power, currently at 10.25% for 2021. The question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable PPAs for projects which are not yet under construction. Despite the above issues, the Group’s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in India owned and developed by a foreign investor. They are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno-economic and environmental features. Despite long term promising prospects, the current Indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties. The Groups’ projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row. These delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of Eur 2.8 million (20% of gross value) decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the Indian projects. This brought the total provision to Eur 7.1 million (50% of gross value), considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years ( EUR 4.4m or 30% of gross value). The Indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter I.4.1 of the annual report available at . Brazil The Rodeio Bonito Hydropower plant (15 MW) recorded a historically low production of 29 496 MWh in 2020, 40% below the 2019 generation (49 113 MWh in 2019) and close to its all-time record low of 2012 (24 793 MWh). However the turnover when expressed in the Brazilian currency (BRL) was up thanks to the inflation and the MRE system. But as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020, the plant had to compensate the MRE system, which was in a negative position. This is why payments to the MRE were much higher, reaching EUR 0.7m in 2020 vs. EUR 0.2m in 2019. As a result the EBITDA of the plant amounted to BRL 8.1m against BRL 9.3m in 2019, down by 13%. When converted in euro, the EBITDA of the plant was significantly lower to EUR 1.4m vs 2.1m in 2019 (-51%) mostly due to a 34% depreciation of the average rate of the Brazilian Real vs Euro currency in 2020. Financial Assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets. The Group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes. The Group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60% in bonds, mostly high yield corporate ones. This bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in January and February, as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks. Since the March 2020 market crunch, the Group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities (mostly gold). As of 31 st  December 2020 , the bonds exposure, including T-bills, was reduced to 19% of the portfolio (64% as of 31/12/19), whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash, financial assets and financial liabilities ( EUR 104.5 m) included:  a negative net cash position of EUR 9.3 m (-9% of the portfolio) versus a positive net debt position of EUR 27.2 m in 2019 (25% of the portfolio), 19% of gold related exposure (versus 1% as of 31/12/2019), 21% of oil related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 4% of silver related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 42% of equity (excluding oil) long positions (7% as of 31/12/2019), 4% of equity short positions (2% in 2019), 1% in private equity and credit (3% in 2019).  While reallocating its financial assets towards equity, the Group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the Covid-19 situation. The two sectors hence selected were banking and energy. This strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the Group net financial assets rose from Eur 103 million to Eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to EUR 7.7 m as of 31/12/2020, stable when compared to 2019 (EUR 8.1 m) and despite the COVID-19 crisis. Given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets ( USA , Europe and Japan ), the Group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term. The Group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the USD and increased its exposure to the Euro and the Japanese Yen. As of 31/12/2020 the Group financial assets were exposed notably to the US Dollars (35% against 67% in 2019), the Japanese Yen (25% against 2% in 2019) and the Euro (22% against 9% in 2019). It is to be noted that the Gold and Silver positions are priced in USD and as such are included in the former USD exposure. Contrary to the previous years, the Group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage (see above / net cash position) The financial portfolio is detailed in part I, section 3.1.B of the annual report 2020 available at . During the year  continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares. The shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares. A total of 492,348 shares were bought back in 2020, for a total price of Eur 3,131,696 . 275,000 shares were cancelled in April 2020 and, as of 31 st  December 2020 ,  held 314,023 own shares representing 5.66% of its share capital. Foreseeable evolution of the Group: After the closing of this financial year, the Group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for FY 2021:  Pursuing the development of the Indian hydropower projects. On the short term, executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the Indian hydropower projects, in order to secure the renewal of the TECs and the renewal of Forest clearances. Continue the active management of its diversified financial investments;   The ability of the Group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current Covid-19 crisis, which may affect both the development of the Indian projects and the financial portfolio. FINANCIAL YEAR 2020 – MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Statement (unaudited consolidated) Turnover amounted to EUR 2.5m (against EUR 2.8m in 2018, a 12% decrease), mainly from electricity sales in Brazil . The turnover in local currency increased by 18% with the inflation on electricity sale prices. However, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency vs the Euro currency was responsible for a 34% decrease of the turnover in Euro. The current operating result amounted to EUR -5.6m (against -4.3m in 2019):  Payments to the MRE (Energy Reallocation Mechanism) were EUR 0.7m in 2020 vs. EUR 0.2m in 2019. Depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of Rodeio Bonito plant amounted to EUR 0.5m ( EUR 0.7m in 2019), while depreciation on intangible projects under development was EUR 2.8 vs an amount of EUR 2.2m in 2019, due to the provision passed on Indian projects. Staff expenses amounted to EUR 2.7m in 2020 vs EUR 2.6m in 2019. The Group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020. External expenses are totaling EUR 1.4m in 2020 vs EUR 1.5m in 2019.  Net Financial Gain for the group amounted to EUR 7.7m in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the USD depreciation (-9% compared to end of 2019) and its impact on the Group’s cash and financial assets position. The impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the Group, avoiding bigger potential forex losses (see breakdown per currency in chapter I.7.4. of the annual report). This gain of 7.7m compares to EUR 8.1m in 2019. In 2020, other operating income ( EUR 0.2m ) consisted mainly of earn out gains on Brazilian assets related to Brazilian assets divested in previous years. This figure was NIL in 2019. Income tax expense amounted to EUR -0.2m in 2020, same as in 2019. The net result, Group share, was EUR 2.1m in 2020 FY compared to EUR 3.6m in 2019. The Group’s EBITDA reached EUR -2.0m compared to EUR -1.4m in 2019. The strong depreciation of BRL (-41%) and INR (Indian Currency -12%) closing rates when compared to Euro, at 2020 closing date, has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income, as the Group’s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency ( EUR -4.5m in 2020 against EUR -0.1m in 2019). The total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of EUR -2.4m in 2020 against a gain of EUR 3.5m in 2019. Balance sheet  –  Assets (unaudited consolidated) Net intangible assets stands at 8.3m in 2020 and are down by EUR 3.7m versus 2019, mostly because of the provision of EUR -2.8m of Indian assets, the depreciation of the Indian currency ( EUR -0.9m ) and the Brazilian currency ( EUR -0.5m ) despite the addition of EUR 0.7m of capitalized costs on Indian projects. Net tangible assets stands at 5.3m in 2020 and decreased by EUR 2.7m between 2019 and 2020, mainly because of depreciation of the Rodeio Bonito plant ( EUR -0.5m ) and the depreciation of the Brazilian currency ( EUR -2.3m ). Cash, cash equivalent assets and financial assets (net of Current financial liabilities) have increased from EUR 103m in 2019 to EUR 105m in 2020 (+1%) mainly thanks the good performance of the Group’s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs. Financial assets consist mainly in listed equity, bonds and commodities related stocks. Finally total assets increased by 15.3% during 2020 FY (up by EUR 18.9 m), mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the “liabilities” and the related asset purchases. At 31 st  December 2020 , the Group ( and its subsidiaries) holds 314,023 own shares (2019: 146,810). At year end closing price of EUR 6.41 those own shares have a market value of EUR 2.0m . Balance sheet –  Liabilities (unaudited consolidated) Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities amount to EUR 0.7m and EUR 1.0m at 31 December 2020 respectively and arise from litigations related to the 2 biomass plants previously owned by the Group (Satyamaharshi SMPCL – 7.5 MW and Rithwik RPPL – 7.5 MW, owned between 2006 and 2010). The existing provision represents the major part of the claims as well as accumulated interests and judicial expenses. Trade and other payables amount to EUR 0.9 m vs EUR 0.5m in 2019 (due to EUR 0.3 m of payable related to MRE payments in Brazil , due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation). Current financial liabilities of EUR 23.9 m in 2020 (vs NIL in 2019) are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the Group to leverage its listed investments trading activities. Under this facility, securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money. This facility has enabled the Group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits. But it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices. Own shares, booked directly against the equity of the Group at their historical cost, reduce the net shareholder’s equity of the Group by EUR -2.1m at 31 st  December 2020 versus EUR -1.2m at 31 st  December 2019 following the share buyback programs ( EUR -3.1m ), the capital reduction ( EUR +1.9m ) and the use of shares to cover share based payments ( EUR +0.4m ). As at 31 st  December 2020 , unrealized losses on conversion reserves, booked directly against the equity amounted to EUR -14.2m versus an unrealized loss of EUR -9.6m at 31 st  December 2019 , as the BRL and INR currencies heavily depreciated VS EUR currency in 2020. With a consolidated equity of EUR 115.8m ( -EUR 5.3m compared to 2019), the Group still has no significant net debt as of 31 st  December 2020 , though it should be noted it uses leverage (cf. the leverage facility mentioned earlier).

San Francisco:  After a successful “Spring Loaded” event, Apple is likely to launch the new iPad Pro with M1 and the upgraded Apple TV 4K with revamped Siri Remote on May 21. Known tipster Jon Prosser updated in a tweet that Apple will also launch the new Apple TV on May 21 along with iPad Pro. The launch date arrives as information from UK retailer John Lewis revealed availability for the new iMac and iPad Pro on May 21, which is when the new Apple 4K TV will also be launched by the Cupertino-based giant. Previously, Prosser believed that the 11-inch model would arrive a day after on May 22, but now the tipster claims that both models would launch on the same date. Recently, Apple has announced its most powerful and advanced iPad Pro ever, featuring an M1 chip, ultra-fast 5G and a stunning 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display. The new 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be available in silver and space grey finishes. iPad Pro is available in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB configurations.

      "Ransomware explained: No silver bullet, crooks out of reach. BOSTON: Political hand-wringing in Washington over Russia’s hacking of federal agencies and interference in US politics has mostly overshadowed a worsening digital scourge with a far broader wallop: crippling and dispiriting extortionary ransomware attacks by cybercriminal mafias that mostly operate in foreign safe havens out of the reach of Western law enforcement.Stricken in the United States alone last year were more than 100 federal, state and municipal agencies, upwards of 500 health care centers, 1,680 educational institutions and untold thousands of businesses, according to the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Dollar losses are in the tens of billions. Accurate numbers are elusive. Many victims shun reporting, fearing the reputational blight.All the while, ransomware gangsters have become more brazen and cocky as they put more and more lives and livelihoods at risk. This week, one syndicate threatened to make available to local criminal gangs data they say they stole from the Washington, D.C., metro police on informants. Another recently offered to share data purloined from corporate victims with Wall Street inside traders. Cybercriminals have even reached out directly to people whose personal info was harvested from third parties to pressure victims to pay up.“In general, the ransomware actors have gotten more bold and more ruthless,” said Allan Liska, an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On April 29, a public-private task force including Microsoft, Amazon, the National Governors Association, the FBI, Secret Service and Britain and Canada’s elite crime agencies delivered to the White House an 81-page urgent action plan for an aggressive and comprehensive whole-of-government assault on ransomware.At the report’s online launch, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a pre-recorded video that the White House is developing a plan for disrupting ransomware and his department “will work to implement many of (the panel’s) recommendations, because one thing is clear: Ransomware is a threat to our national security.”Mayorkas last month announced a DHS ransomware initiative, and the Department of Justice has just created a task force to tackle the scourge.Where did ransomware come from? How does it work?The criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly Russian-speaking and operate with near impunity out of Russia and allied countries. They are a continuation and refinement - ransomware was barely a blip three years ago - of more than two decades of cyber-thieving that spammed, stole credit cards and identities and emptied bank accounts. The syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill, leveraging dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with tools like the Tor browser and cryptocurrencies that make payments - and their laundering - harder to track.Ransomware scrambles a victim organisation’s data with encryption. The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and, once paid, provide software decryption keys.Last year, ransomware crooks expanded into data-theft blackmail. Before triggering encryption, they quietly exfiltrate sensitive files and threaten to expose them publicly unless ransoms are paid. Victims who diligently backed up their networks as a hedge against ransomware now had to think twice about refusing to pay. At the end of 2019, only one ransomware group had an extortion site online that would publish such files. Now more than two dozen do.Victims who refuse to pay can incur costs that far exceed the ransoms they might have negotiated. It happened recently to the University of Vermont Health Network. It suffered an estimated US$1.5mil a day in losses in the two months it took to recover. More than 5,000 hospital computers, their data scrambled into gibberish, had to be wiped clean and reconstituted from backed-up data.The University of California-San Francisco, heavily involved in Covid-19 research, barely hesitated before paying. It gave the criminals US$1.1mil last June. Manufacturers have been especially hard-hit this year, with ransoms of US$50mil demanded of computer makers Acer and Quanta, a major supplier of Apple laptops.How are these criminals organised?Some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals. They take pride in their “customer service”, providing “help desks” that assist paying victims in file decryption. And they tend to keep their word. They have brands to protect, after all.“If they stick to their promises, future victims will be encouraged to pay up,” Maurits Lucas, director of intelligence solutions at the cybersecurity firm Intel471, told a webinar earlier this year. “As a victim you actually know their reputation.”The business tends to be compartmentalised. An affiliate will identify, map out and infect targets, choose victims and deploy ransomware that is typically “rented” from a ransomware-as-a-service provider. The provider gets a cut of the payout, the affiliate normally taking more than three-quarters. Other subcontractors may also get a slice. That can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running the so-called “bulletproof domains” behind which the ransomware gangs hide their “command-and-control” servers. Those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation, a stealthy process that can take weeks.Why do ransoms keep climbing? How can they be stopped?In Thursday’s report, the task force says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments, largely because “ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack”.The task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy. Worse, the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim’s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit. They’ve been known to mention it in negotiations.That degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than US$310,000 last year, up 171% from 2019, according to Palo Alto Networks, a task force member.Not surprisingly, the still-young cyber-insurance industry is reeling. Premiums have gone up by 50% to 100% in the past year as ransomware became the No. 1 claim, said Michael Phillips, chief claims officer of Resilience Insurance and a co-chair of the task force. On average, cyber-insurance claim payouts can now exceed 70% of what is paid in premiums - prompting some insurers to drop this type of insurance altogether, industry reports show.The multi-pronged response to ransomware proposed by the task force will require the kind of concerted diplomatic, legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies that the Trump administration shunned, displacing what the authors call the current “uncoordinated, disjointed” response.“There is no silver bullet, but if we’re going to shift the trajectory of this type of attack the US government has got to get at this with some speed,” said task force co-chair Philip Reiner, CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology.Ransomware developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed (they are not always easy to identify) and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions, the report urges.It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal “response fund” to provide financial assistance to victims - in hopes that, in many cases, it will prevent them from paying ransoms. And it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware proceeds.The task force also calls for something potentially controversial: amending the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to let private industry actively block or limit online criminal activity, including of botnets, the networks of hijacked zombie computers that ransomware criminals use to sow infections.The odds of successfully stifling ransomware are high, the report’s authors acknowledge: “The old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once, while a defender has to be lucky every minute of every day, has never been more true.”- AP\n",

      "Financial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India. First-generation Indian migrants are far more likely to return to India annually to visit family, friends, or relatives, attend family events, or travel across the country. During these short trips, they have been known to squeeze in their financial appointments for India-based investment decisions. This hasty process usually leads to critical investment decisions being pushed aside or delegated to relatives or friends, which ultimately leads to financial pitfalls. In our experience with NRIs, some of the usual pitfalls they are known to fall into and must consciously try to avoid are as follows: Investing as a resident  Once an individual attains the status of an NRI he must convert his existing bank accounts to an NRE, NRO, or FCNR accounts. As an NRI you can open an & NRO account that are rupee designated accounts and are repatriable. Similarly, investment instruments like MFs , direct equity, bonds, and more have their restrictions. For instance, an NRIs DEMAT account will need to be converted to an NRO DEMAT account, while stock trading activities will need to be routed through a PIS (Portfolio Investment Scheme) account. The rules and regulations are ever-changing; keen NRI investors need to keep abreast with these changes to avoid falling into the trap of losses. Barred Investments  Often NRI’s tend to continue with their residential status-based investment instruments as well, ignoring processes and regulations. For instance, as an NRI settled in the USA there are restrictions to which mutual fund houses you are allowed to invest through. This is due to the stringent compliance requirement by the USA & Canada’s regulatory body FATCA. To avoid the complexities in compliance only a handful of investing houses accept investments from NRIs residing in the US. For NRI’s in other nations continuing with the current MFs may require a simple status change update by submitting the necessary documentation. Also Read: Why NRIs should use the mutual fund route to investments  The taxation web  Tax avoidance or double taxation is another pitfall that most NRIs fail to account for. Income earned in India, which exceeds the specified amount, in the form of interest, dividends from equity shares or MFs, rent, capital gain, etc. become liable for tax filing. In some countries income earned in India could be taxable both in India as well as in the country of the NRIs residence. To circumvent this double taxation burden on NRIs a tax treaty better known as the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) is signed between India and multiple countries. This treaty assists in tackling the problem of tax avoidance as well as determines the efficient method implied to tax an NRI income. This avoids double taxation and offers relief by reducing the burden of taxes on income earned, provided a DTAA provision exists between the two countries. Beyond intent, the foremost reason for NRIs to default on taxes is unawareness linked to the Indian tax laws that are constantly changing. Zero diversification  Tying your portfolio to a single asset class or even a single country’s fate is a gamble. NRIs often fail to diversify their investments across asset classes and invest in fixed returns assets like FD’s or physical assets like gold and real estate. The reason for this tunneled vision could be correlated to avoidance of the complicated web of regulations, transactional compliances, and taxation by NRIs. Reports suggest NRI investments in Indian real estate are likely to grow at 12% in FY22. The average prices of properties in leading markets like NCR and Mumbai showed flat growth in the October-December period of 2020 as compared to the previous year (2019). Falling interest rates too have caused traditional asset classes like FD’s and more to lose their sheen. There are multiple avenues for NRIs to choose from that are both risky as well as secured. Mutual funds, NPS , direct equity, PPF , and more are avenues that can be considered based on the financial goals of the investor, be it early retirement, post-retirement planning or simply securing their dependents' future. Digital Assets  The latest fad of Non-Fungible Tokens NFTs and Cryptocurrency along with its ambiguity over its legality by Indian laws are leaving investors in a tizzy. Young NRIs that are tech-savvy often tend to invest massive amounts of their corpus in such digital assets. Owing to its volatility and legal repercussions (especially in India) it is best if investors maintain investing in such assets within their allocated limit ensuring that its uncertainty or volatility does not put their complete financial portfolio at risk. Also Read: Here's a step by step guide for NRIs to retire rich  Controlling Outflows  Clearing off all forms of debt needs to be top a priority for every investor. First-generation NRIs who migrate often have loans for a home, education, or personal requirements. They must ensure to plan repayment and pre-payment of these loans from day 1. It is easy to get carried away and spend on lifestyle expenses in a new country. Prudent planning ensures you stay in control of your expenses and invest efficiently, especially during these unprecedented times of volatile markets, job cuts, visa delays, and more. As NRIs, investing in Indian markets need not be a burdensome task. Today, in the post-pandemic world processes and procedures have swiftly moved to online modes offering investors much transactional ease, even if they are across borders. The Indian markets are proving their grit and potential, it is now time for NRIs to decide if they want to benefit from India’s future potential.\n",

      "BOOK REVIEW | A Short History of Humanity. How Migration Made Us Who We Are By Johannes Krause and Thomas Trappe Humanity has often found itself on the precipice. We’ve survived and thrived because we’ve never stopped moving. In this eye-opening book, Johannes Krause, Chair of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Humanity, offers a new way of understanding our past, present and future.  The toughest opponent humanity had ever faced  Marshalling unique insights from archaeogenetics, an emerging new discipline that allows us to read our ancestors’ DNA like journals chronicling personal stories of migration, Krause charts two millennia of adaption, movement and survival, culminating in the triumph of Homo Sapiens as we swept through Europe and beyond in successive waves of migration – developing everything from language, the patriarchy, disease, art and a love of pets as we did so. We also meet our ancestors, from those many of us have heard of – such as Homo Erectus and the Neanderthals – to the wildly unfamiliar but no less real: the recently discovered Denisovans, who ranged across Asia and, like humans, interbred with Neanderthals; the Aurignacians, skilled artists who, 40,000 years ago, brought about an extraordinary transformation in what our species could invent and create; the Varna, who buried their loved ones with gold long before the Pharaohs of Egypt did; and the Gravettians, big game hunters who were Europe’s most successful early settlers until they perished in the face of the toughest opponent humanity had ever faced: the ice age. As well as being a radical new telling of our shared story, this book is a reminder that the global problems that keep us awake at night – climate catastrophe; the sudden emergence of deadly epidemics; refugee crises; ethnic conflict; overpopulation – are all things we’ve faced, and overcome, before.  About the authors  Johannes Krause is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and a brilliant pioneer in the field of archaeogenetics—archaeology augmented by DNA sequencing technology—which has allowed scientists to reconstruct human history reaching back hundreds of thousands of years before recorded time. Thomas Trappe is a political journalist but has frequently worked in science journalism and reported several times on Johannes Krause’\n",

      "Trident Royalties PLC. Q1 2021 Activities Update. Trident Royalties (LSE:TRR) Intraday Stock Chart Friday 30 April 2021 TIDMTRR RNS Number : 1474X Trident Royalties PLC. 30 April 2021 30 April 2021 Trident Royalties Plc (\"Trident\" or the \"Company\") Q1 2021 Activities Update Transformational Lithium Royalty Acquisition & Fundraising, Continued Strength in Commodities Trident Royalties Plc (AIM: TRR, FSX: 5KV), is pleased to provide an update on its activities undertaken during the first quarter ended 31 March 2021, including Q1 royalty receipts. HIGHLIGHTS Q1 saw a significant increase in battery metals exposure, in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing -- Trident completed its most significant transaction to-date with the acquisition of a 60% interest in a gross revenue royalty (\"GRR\") over the Thacker Pass Project (\"Thacker Pass\"), for a total consideration of US$28.0 million, comprising US$26.0 million in cash and US$2.0 million in new ordinary shares in Trident. Thacker Pass contains the largest defined lithium Mineral Reserve in the United States; -- A successful concurrent equity financing of approximately GBP20.7 million (approximately US$28.8 million) was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the Thacker Pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet; -- Trident completed the Talga gold royalties transaction and, shortly post quarter end, completed the previously announced Pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction, finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties; and -- With a portfolio inclusive of copper, iron ore, gold, and now lithium, Trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector, providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once-in-a-generation energy revolution. Q1 royalty payments totalling approximately US$451,314 from royalties over producing assets, an increase of 55% over Q4 2020 Royalty / Stream Q1 2021 Payment Cumulative Payments since Acquisition Koolyanobbing iron A$100,479 A$2,740,884 ore royalty (1) --------------------------- ------------------------------- Mimbula copper royalty US$375,000 US$453,707 --------------------------- ------------------------------- -- Mimbula copper royalty payment of US$375,000 based on the Minimum Payment Schedule (\"MPS\") under the royalty agreement, representing a significant increase over Q4 2020. Q1 2021 production saw 671 tonnes of copper sold, an increase over Q4 2020 as the project continues to ramp up; -- The MPS on the Mimbula copper royalty continues in 2021 (US$375,000 per quarter in 2021, less any excess payments made above the MPS from previous quarters, increasing to US$500,000 per quarter in 2022 and US$750,000 for the first two quarters of 2023)(2) ; -- Koolyanobbing iron ore royalty payment of A$100,479 (US$76,314(3) ), a decrease over Q4 2020 on higher received price but lower volumes from the royalty area; -- Trident notes the average grade at Koolyanobbing has fallen from 59% to 57% Fe since 2H20. Recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market, particularly for low-grade fines products, may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term.(4) Trident's royalty covers a substantial portion of the Deception pit, the highest-grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total Koolyanobbing reserves. Trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the Company in the short-medium term; -- Trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by Mineral Resources Limited, the project operator, which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10-year plan for the Yilgarn Hub, of which Koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component. Additionally, Mineral Resources flagged the expansion of the Yilgarn Hub to 12Mtpa as a further growth opportunity; and -- Commodity prices underlying Trident's royalty portfolio remained strong throughout Q1 2021 with iron ore averaging US$131/tonne, copper averaging $8,503/tonne, lithium carbonate equivalent (\"LCE\") averaging US$9,083/tonne, and gold averaging US$1,793 /oz.(5) Post quarter end, copper has continued to climb to near 10-year highs, while LCE prices have now doubled year-to-date to over US$13,500/tonne. Q1 royalty portfolio growth, combined with positive asset-level progress by project operators -- Thacker Pass Lithium Project (6) : In January 2021, Lithium Americas Corp (\"LAC\"), the project operator, announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project, followed shortly thereafter by a US$400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction. With the acquisition of 60% of the GRR, Trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production. Other highlights include: -- Thacker Pass currently contains a CIM compliant Mineral Reserve of 3.1Mt LCE, the largest lithium reserve in the United States, with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves. -- Thacker Pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") announced on 21 June 2018 and a Definitive Feasibility Study due for completion in 2021. -- LAC has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and Trident expects Phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024. -- The GRR is subject to a partial operator buy-back which Trident expects will be exercised by LAC for proceeds to Trident of US$13.2 million during the first year of operation (the \"Buyback\"). -- Based on the PFS parameters published by LAC (including an LCE price of $12,000/tonne), Phase 1 steady-state royalty revenue attributable to Trident is anticipated to be approximately US$3.8 million per annum, increasing to US$7.6 million per annum at Phase 2 steady-state (assuming the Buy-Back occurs before operations commence). -- As anticipated, the third-party claimant has named Trident as a party to the existing litigation between Orion Resource Partners regarding the GRR. The seller of the royalty has provided Trident with an indemnity (subject to customary limitations and exclusions) in respect of such proceedings. -- Lake Rebecca Gold Project: Apollo Consolidated Ltd (\"Apollo\"), the project operator, has committed a material budget increase to advance the Lake Rebecca Gold Project(7) (\"Lake Rebecca\"), de-risking the route to a future development decision: -- Apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the Seguela Gold Project in Cote D'Ivoire for A$20M cash. It stated that the sale \"will add to existing cash reserves\" placing Apollo \"in a very strong position to take Rebecca forward.\" -- Apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around Lake Rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies(8) . -- Apollo recently issued a JORC (2012) compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") update, providing a 50% increase in Indicated Mineral Resources to 815,000 ounces to a combined total indicated and inferred optimised pit-constrained 1.105M ounces gold Mineral Resource(9) . -- The MRE update also noted the commencement of key technical studies to progress a potential +8 year mining and processing operation. With A$37.1M in cash and receivables on hand, Apollo remains well funded to aggressively advance Lake Rebecca(9) . -- Additional geotechnical drilling on the eastern side of the Lake Rebecca deposit will assist in the outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine; drilling has intersected wide zones of high-grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the Jennifer Structure(10) . -- Apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource, with intersections up to 16m @ 4.12g/t Au and 7.4m @ 4.70g/t Au respectively. -- Geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation. -- Spring Hill Gold Project: Trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the Spring Hill Gold Project (\"Spring Hill\") under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). The approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of Spring Hill, clearing the way for next steps toward development. -- Pukaqaqa Copper Project: Nexa Resources SA, the project operator, noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre-feasibility metallurgical results for the Pukaqaqa Copper Project were concluded in December 2020, \"demonstrating better results than previous campaigns, including improved recoveries and grades. During 2021, variability tests to confirm results will be held.\" The project budget has been increased by 60% from 2020, to US$2.4 million in 2021 to allow for further metallurgical testing and environmental closure works in the drilling area(11) . -- Warrawoona Gold Project: Calidus Resources Ltd (\"Calidus\"), the project operator, is completing an integration study on its Blue Spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining Blue Spec and trucking ore to the nearby Warrawoona plant, potentially increasing the robustness of Warrawoona by increasing operating margins(12) . In addition, Caldius noted in its corporate presentation that Warrawoona will \"commence main construction this quarter\", as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022. -- Mosquito Creek Gold Project: Calidus has entered into a Farm-In Agreement with Nimble Resources(13) , the project operator, which gives Calidus the right to earn up to 90% of the Mosquito Creek tenement E46/1035, located about 75km from its Warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the Blue Spec mining proposition. -- E46/1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west, Calidus states that 'many soil and rock-chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling' and 'fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year'. -- Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Project: In its Q3 FY2021 quarterly results(14) , Mineral Resources Limited stated that 2.5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the Yilgarn Hub for the quarter. Trident holds a 1.5% free-on-board royalty over the M77/1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the Deception pit, which forms part of the broader Koolyanobbing iron ore operation in Western Australia. -- Mimbula Copper Project: Production continues to ramp up at the Mimbula Copper Project and, with the copper price recently touching near 10-year highs supported by solid fundamentals, the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment. Strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions -- Unaudited cash balance of US$7.4 million as of 31 March 2021 (not inclusive of Q1 royalty revenue, which was received post-quarter end); -- This substantial cash balance - coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in Trident - supports capacity for future acquisitions; -- In addition, Trident entered into a term sheet with Tribeca Global Resources Credit Pty Ltd during Q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of US$10 million. The Facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent; -- Indicative of the strength of the pipeline, Trident currently has 11 active NDAs under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands, lead, nickel, copper, gold, zinc, cobalt, potash, and iron ore; and -- Trident continues to prioritise production or near-production assets in order to materially build Trident's near-term revenue profile. Adam Davidson, Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented: \"The first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for Trident since its admission to trading on AIM less than a year ago, with the $28 million acquisition of 60% of the Thacker Pass lithium royalty, coupled with a substantial equity raise. The fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price, was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the Company. In addition to funding our Thacker Pass transaction, we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio - both through acquisition as well as positive asset-level progress. This bodes exceptionally well for Trident, particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities. Within the last quarter we've seen material positive updates at Lake Rebecca, Spring Hill and the Western Australian Gold Royalty package tenements. Revenue continues to remain volatile across Trident's two paying royalties, a factor which underpins the opportunity available to Trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers, to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile. Trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space, with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue.\" References (1) Inclusive of GST (2) Source: Trident Royalties announcement dated 29 June 2020 https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/trident/news/rns/story/r73y4gx/export (3) AUD = 0.7595 USD (31 March 2021) (4) Source: Mineral Resources Limited Quarterly Activities Report - Q3 FY21 https://clients3.weblink.com.au/pdf/MIN/02364104.pdf (5) Source: Factset, 62% Fe (CFR), Copper (LME), Gold (LBMA).

Key highlights of Trident's strategy include: -- Building a royalty and streaming portfolio to broadly mirror the commodity exposure of the global mining sector (excluding thermal coal) with a bias towards production or near-production assets, differentiating Trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively, or heavily weighted, to precious metals; -- Acquiring royalties and streams in resource-friendly jurisdictions worldwide, while most competitors have portfolios focused on North and South America; -- Targeting attractive small-to-mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players; -- Active deal-sourcing which, in addition to writing new royalties and streams, will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers, such as: closed-end funds, prospect generators, junior and mid-tier miners holding royalties as non-core assets, and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market; -- Maintaining a low-overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs; and -- Leveraging the experience of management, the board of directors, and Trident's adviser team, all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions. The acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified, larger scale portfolio. Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt. Once scale has been achieved, strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy, providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection, growth and income.

      "New Holland Agriculture wins three medals at 2001 SIMA Innovation and Edison Awards. New Holland Agriculture’s innovation in combine harvesting has been recognized with a silver and a bronze medal at the SIMA Innovation Awards while the brand’s  Loop Master TM knotting technology for balers has won the gold medal at th is year’s edition of the Edison Awards . London, April 30, 2021 SIMA AWARDS 2021 New Holland Agriculture, a global agricultural brand of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI / MI:CNHI), was awarded a silver and bronze medal at the SIMA 2021 Innovation Awards in recognition for its innovations in combine harvesting technology. The internationally renowned awards of SIMA, which hosts the bi-annual international farm machinery exhibition of the same name, honor the agricultural industry’s most innovative equipment, products, techniques and services. They are conferred by an international jury panel of industry specialists who are assisted by a network of technical experts. The silver medal was awarded in the “From Harvest to Storage” category for NutriSense TM , the in-harvest nutrient analysis system which collects agronomic data enabling the farmer to make informed decisions in order to maximize their sales. The integration of the Near Infrared (NIR) sensor enables the analysis, recording and mapping of crop composition during harvest. The bronze medal was awarded in the “Parts, Services and Onboard Electronics” category to the Cleaning system pressure sensors. This exclusive patented cleaning shoe pressure analysis system enables a faster harvesting speed while guaranteeing maximum quality. The system measures the pressure in the cleaning shoe of the combine and alerts the operator as to whether any adjustments are required enabling them to optimize the harvest.

      "Super Soco’s CPx ‘super-scooter’: Going electric for a germ-free commute. Sales of electric motorcycles are big news for the bike industry; latest figures show that March registrations in this sector this year are up by 151 per cent over the same month in 2020, while nearly half of all new low-powered scooters are now battery powered. Could it be because commuters, post-Covid, are fearful of rubbing shoulders with strangers on public transport, because it’s easier to filter past  caused by the spread of ‘emergency’ LTNs, or because they’re fun, relatively inexpensive to run and  friendly? It’s probably a mix of all three, but to find what all the fuss is about, I jumped on one of the latest new machines, the CPx ‘super-scooter’ from Super Soco, who claim it’s similar in performance to a 125cc two-wheeler. Attractively styled, the CPx comes either with one battery, offering a claimed range of 44 miles, or two, offering a claimed range of 87 miles. The price difference between the two is significant, with the single-battery model costing £3,599 (after taking the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles grant into consideration) and the dual-battery model costing £4,699, demonstrating just how pricey battery technology still is. The CPx comes in black, grey or silver, and is backed by a two-year warranty for the vehicle, three for the battery. It can be ridden on an A1 licence (requiring training, after which, if you pass the various test levels, you will be entitled to carry a pillion and ride on the motorway, although I wouldn’t recommend that on the CPx with its limited top speed). The Super Soco is reasonably well equipped, with a smart, clear LCD display, reasonably good build quality, a big, comfy (thought slightly too high) squashy seat, a tall, clear, protective screen, very decent rear-view mirrors, a useful parcel rack, a side stand as well as centre stand, and even a reverse mode (useful, perhaps, for getting out of tight front-garden parking spaces). It is - of course - eerily quiet once you turn the key, and all it requires to get moving (there’s no clutch or gears) is a twist of the throttle, which sees the bike spring to life and surge forward thanks to its 4.8Kw (5hp) hub-mounted electric motor. In London traffic it kept up nicely with other vehicles from a standing start; in fact its forte is leaping smartly away from traffic lights. Acceleration is reasonably swift and progressive (at least when the batteries are well-charged; during our brief assessment they didn’t drop below 80 per cent), right up to the claimed top speed of around 55mph. The brakes (both operated by hand controls as with a bicycle) worked firmly and effectively, and the steering was sufficiently ‘quick’ to make filtering around other traffic very efficient indeed. It also felt grippy on the road in bends, despite having fairly narrow tyres, although we didn’t ride it in the wet. Compared to the more basic model launched by Super Soco and reviewed here in 2017, the CPx is far more advanced. Thanks to the 16-inch front wheel the CPx felt stable and well able to cope with lumps and bumps in the road - at least at the front end. At the rear, where there’s a smaller 14-inch rear wheel, the CPx’s ability to soak up bumps was more limited; you need to slow down for sharper-edged ramps to avoid a jolt through the seat. The CPx was very easy to push into and out of parking spaces (important in London), stable when parked on its side-stand and easy to hoist onto its equally-stable centre stand. Despite its rakish looks there’s not much in the way of luxury - it’s a scooter after all - but there’s a small hidey-hole (large enough for a phone though I wouldn’t advise it, it might bounce out) in the leg shields, next to a hook (useful perhaps for carrying take-aways or small shopping bags). There’s also a USB socket for charging purposes, a built-in alarm, decent-sized pillion foot pegs and an ‘ignition’ operated steering lock. The batteries live under the hinged seat and can be charged from a standard household plug in situ, or easily detached and carried indoors to be plugged in. They are heavy, mind, at nearly 20kgs each. You wouldn’t want to carry them far. Likes? The CPx is a cinch to ride, very quiet, and (unless you count the fumes going up the electric power station chimney) very ‘clean’. It’s also stable and (vicious speed bumps aside) comfy. Dislikes? The otherwise effective screen felt perilously close to my face; I’d prefer it to have been angled further away, for safety. The seat is high and broad on account of the size of the batteries, so will put shorter riders off. I would also have preferred more built-in stowage, but there really isn’t room. If it was mine, I’d invest in a small top box, fitted to the rack. So who’s going to buy it? You could find a new petrol-powered scooter for less but that, of course, would cause more pollution and wouldn’t give you the same, electric, environmental feel-good factor while  through London. It will appeal to those who like the easy, unintimidating, approachable nature of an electric scooter, and to those for whom environmental issues are paramount. Crucially it is also - according to figures supplied by Super Soco - considerably cheaper to run than a petrol model. It’s worth noting, however, that according to motorcycle ‘bible’ MCN, which conducted extensive tests, performance on the CPx can drop off as the batteries’ charge level goes down. They also said they were able to achieve an 80-mile range with two batteries; but only by remaining under 30mph; no problem in London. Super Soco’s own sums show that an average 125cc petrol scooter costs 5p per mile to run, compared to just 1p for the CPx. Over a year, for a typical 23-mile, round commute, over 256 working days a year, that amounts to a cost of £294.40 for a petrol scooter, or a winning £58.88 for the CPx. There’s the added convenience of not having to stop at petrol stations. Charging the batteries, instead, they say, takes 3-4 hours and can be done at home or the office. A petrol scooter costs £25 a year to tax, while the keeper of an electric scooter pays nothing. Maintenance is also far less of an issue for electric bikes, as there are fewer moving parts. If the CPx’s battery should ever need replacing outside warranty, however, it’s hardly cheap, at over £1,800. So there you have it - a clean, quiet, guilt-free new-tech solution to commuting around London post-Covid, while avoiding all those potentially germy commuters on the bus and tube.

      "Two injured as teen gang ransacks, loots house in Tongi. Miscreants ransacked HM Meher’s house in Bommala Shantibagh area in Tongi, Gazipur on April 30, 2021 Dhaka Tribune While ransacking the house, they stole money, a few gold ornaments, a laptop and three mobile phones At least two people were injured when members of a teen gang attacked and looted a house in Bommala Shantibagh area in Tongi, Gazipur. “The incident took place on Thursday evening,” Gazipur Metropolitan Police (GMP) Tongi Zone Assistant Commissioner Piyush Dey after visiting the spot. The injured were identified as HM Meher, 50, and his son Jaglul Haider, 21. They were treated for their injuries at the Shaheed Ahsan Ullah Master General Hospital in Tongi. \"On Wednesday night, a teenager named Rahmat called out my son Jaglul from our house and took him away,\" HM Meher told Dhaka Tribune. “Later, Rahmat and some other boys took my son to the Banamala rail crossing area where they beat him up and left him bleeding on the railway line,” he added. “After the incident, Jaglul was rescued and returned home after undergoing treatment at the hospital. He later wrote a post on Facebook mentioning gang member Rahmat's name over the incident.”  “In the afternoon, Sabbir alias KBD, a drug dealer and a member of the teenage gang, came to the front of our house with a sharp knife (switchgear) and attacked my son again. Seeing the situation, the locals in the area helped us detain Sabbir,” Meher added. “Upon receiving the news of Sabbir’s detainment, a group of 25 to 30 youths led by Sajal Sarkar, the main leader of the Dattapara youth gang, attacked and looted Meher’s house with sharp weapons. While ransacking the house, they stole money, a few gold ornaments, a laptop and three mobile phones.  While leaving, they also threatened the local shopkeepers, asking them to keep their mouths shut about the incident, Meher mentioned GMP Assistant Commissioner Piyush Dey said several police teams had visited the house after receiving information and action will be taken following an investigation.  However, the police official claimed that the involvement of the teenage gang was not correct.\n",

      "Implats 3Q PGM Production Slips; Backs Full-Year Guidance. By Jaime Llinares Taboada Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. on Friday reported that its production of platinum group metals fell in the fiscal third quarter, but reaffirmed full-year guidance. The South African mining company refined 800,000 ounces of 6E platinum group metals--platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and gold--in the three months ended March 31, it said. This was down from 862,000 ounces a year earlier, when the company undertook a material reduction in excess accumulated inventory. Conversely, sales volumes increased 14% to 862,000 ounces in the period, the company said. In addition, Implats reaffirmed full-year guidance of 3.2 million-3.5 million ounces, with adjusted operating costs of 14,600 rand-15,100 rand ($1,026-$1,061) per 6E ounce, and capital expenditure of ZAR5.8 billion-ZAR6.2 billion. Chief Executive Nico Muller said Implats continues to demonstrate resilience during the pandemic, adding that rand PGM pricing remains elevated.

      "Main Event – April 22, 2021: An Angle?  On This Show?. Main Event  Date: April 22, 2021 Location: Yuengling Center, Tampa, Florida Commentators: Kevin Patrick, Byron Saxton The Wrestlemania fallout continues and that means we are on the way to Wrestlemania Backlash because now we have something else called Wrestlemania. I’m not sure how much you can expect from this show, but you can almost guarantee who you are going to see doing it. Let’s get to it. Here are last week’s results if you need a recap. Opening sequence. Mansoor vs. Akira Tozawa Tozawa takes him down into a chinlock and then switches over to a headlock. That’s reversed into a cradle so they get back up and run the ropes, with Mansoor dropping down three times in a row. Tozawa eventually trips over him but is right back with a Shining Wizard for two. The backsplash gets the same and, with both of them sitting, they chop it out. It’s Tozawa getting the better of things and grabs a chinlock but Mansoor fights back up with a spinebuster. The DDT gives Mansoor two so Tozawa sends him to the apron, allowing Mansoor to come back with the slingshot neckbreaker for the pin at 5:33. Rating: C. Just another Mansoor win here as the winning streak continues as we move towards another Saudi Arabia show. I’m not sure if it is going to be anything noteworthy in the end but Mansoor is having good enough matches against decent opponents. It would be nice if that meant something before they go overseas again, but I would be stunned if we saw that. Quick look at Roman Reigns retaining at Wrestlemania. From Smackdown. Here is Roman Reigns, flanked by Jey Uso and Paul Heyman. After looking around for a bit, Reigns has Heyman explain the kind of competition he had to face. Heyman explains who Daniel Bryan and Edge are, allowing Reigns to talk about how no one is on his level. He has done everything he was asked to do and stacked up the competition to pin them both at once. With that out of the way, cut the check and fire up the jet. Reigns goes to leave but here’s Cesaro to interrupt, which gets Reigns’ attention. He leaves anyway as Cesaro stares him all the way to Wrestlemania: Backlash . From Smackdown. Cesaro vs. Jey Uso Uso sends him into the ropes to start but Cesaro gets in a quick slam to take over. Cesaro takes him to the apron and goes after Cesaro’s hand but gets knocked to the floor. The dive off of the apron drops Uso and we take a break. We come back with Uso work working on the arm to try and keep Cesaro down. Uso goes up but gets caught with a dropkick. A gutwrench superplex gives Cesaro two and he cartwheels out of an armdrag. Cesaro nails a springboard uppercut and McAfee is rather impressed. Uso is back with a pop up neckbreaker for two but Cesaro nails a discus lariat. The Swing goes on but here is Seth Rollins to jump Cesaro for the DQ at 11:10. Rating: C+. Good enough while it lasted but they telegraphed the ending the entire night with the UFO clip. That isn’t a terrible thing, but it also didn’t give us the most drama. Cesaro is looking primed for a one off shot against Reigns, but it also might be better to have him beat Rollins again first. Reigns isn’t going to lose to Cesaro, so building him up a bit more first is a good way to make Wrestlemania not seem like a fluke. Post match Rollins lays him out and shouts that Cesaro got lucky. The sooner Cesaro figures that out, the better it is for him. Quick look at Drew McIntyre winning a triple threat to become the new #1 contender to Bobby Lashley but getting laid out by Mace and T-Bar. From Raw. Here is Drew McIntyre to get things going. We get a recap of him winning a triple threat match last week to become #1 contender to Bobby Lashley. After the win, he was attacked by Mace and T-Bar, with MVP looking on in approval. With the recap of last week out of the way, McIntyre recaps last week. McIntyre gets to Mace and T-Bar, but he doesn’t believe that they are the masterminds here. That would be MVP, which has McIntyre wondering if Mace and T-Bar are going to start wearing those nice suits. Cue MVP, who implies he didn’t know anything about it, causing Drew to mock him for suggesting he didn’t know anything about it. MVP says Lashley is expecting McIntyre to be a worthy challenger at Wrestlemania Backlash. As for Mace and T-Bar, Lashley recently decided to downsize the Hurt Business, so why would he need those two after he already beat McIntyre at Wrestlemania? Mace and T-Bar have ZERO affiliation with the Hurt Business. McIntyre doesn’t seem to buy it but here are Mace and T-Bar to jump him again. The double sitout chokeslam drops McIntyre and the two walk past MVP, who doesn’t really respond. From Raw. Drew McIntyre vs. Mace/T-Bar No partner for McIntyre, who charges at T-Bar and hammers away to start. A kick to the face sets up a battle over a suplex with McIntyre pulling it off for two. MVP is watching in the back as Mace comes in to unload on McIntyre in the corner. Some running knees put McIntyre down and we hit the chinlock….and go to a wide shot to show off the Thunderdome for some reason (ala Vince McMahon in the mid 90s pay per views). Mace suplexes him for two but McIntyre hits T-Bar with a spinebuster for two. The Glasgow Kiss slows T-Bar down but Mace’s distraction lets the double teaming begin. The referee throws it out at 5:57. Rating: C-. This didn’t have time to go very far but at least Mace and T-Bar didn’t get pinned right out of the box. It isn’t a win, but they lost because they were beating McIntyre up instead of a result of the opposite. I’m still curious about where this goes, though I have next to no confidence in it going anywhere positive for them in the long term. Immediately after the bell, here’s Braun Strowman to clear off not Retribution. Load up the tag match. Braun Strowman/Drew McIntyre vs. T-Bar/Mace Yeah you knew it was coming as soon as the music hit. Strowman powers out of a headlock to start and then runs Mace over with a shoulder. Drew certainly likes that and Braun forearms Mace down. T-Bar comes in and is pounded down into the corner as well. A Mace distraction lets T-Bar get in a chop block though and we hit the reverse chinlock. T-Bar knees him in the back and grabs another chinlock but Strowman backdrops his way to freedom. The hot tag brings in McIntyre to pick up the pace, including an overhead belly to belly to Mace. There’s a jumping neckbreaker into McIntyre’s nip up….and there goes Mace’s mask. Commentary doesn’t seem to recognize him as a former member of their family, even as McIntyre hits him with the mask for the DQ at 5:24. Rating: C-. Just a tag match here but losing the mask might get rid of a little bit of the Retribution stigma. Again, this is better than the team getting pinned, though it still isn’t exactly the best way to make them seem like big stars either. They went with another tag formula match here and that was fine, though it would be nice to see Mace and T-Bar pin someone. Like, ever. Post match Strowman rips off T-Bar’s mask and knocks him outside as well. The start of non Retribution’s theme sounds like Neville’s NXT music. Stills of Bianca Belair winning the Smackdown Women’s Title at Wrestlemania. From Smackdown. Here are the Street Profits to take part in Bianca Belair’s championship celebration. Back from a break with the Profits talking about how Wrestlemania was a night to remember but there was one match that stood out about the others. We get a video on Belair beating Sasha Banks to win the SmackDown Women’s Title, including the media attention that followed. Montez Ford talks about how special that was and brings out Belair to for the big presentation as champion. Belair takes her time soaking in a loud EST chant and says she can’t believe she got here. If you told her she would be here with this title….well she probably would have said yes, because that is who she is. You should never apologize for being the b-e-s-t because if you can dream it, you can do it. Then there is Sasha Banks, who pushed her like no one ever has and both of them made history. They both did, but Belair is the champ. The title is for everyone who believed in her and they are just getting started creating history. They all hug but Belair tells Ford to get back to business, because it’s time to get some more gold. Lince Dorado vs. Drew Gulak Gran Metalik is here with Lince. They go to the mat to start and get nowhere so let’s have a standoff instead. Gulak takes him down by the leg and grabs a hammerlock. That’s broken up so Gulak takes him down into a chinlock instead. Dorado is back up again and snaps off a running hurricanrana so Gulak plants him with a side slam. We take a break and come back with commentary explaining that there is a wager on the match: if Gulak wins, he gets $1000 but if he loses, he has to wash the House Party’s laundry. I’m not sure if I should be more amazed by there being an actual angle or by commentary forgetting to mention that until a few minutes into the match. Anyway, Gulak hits a sitout powerbomb for two and we’re back in the chinlock. Dorado fights up and gets two off a backslide, followed by a Lionsault press for two more. There’s a faceplant for the third two in a row but Gulak electric chair faceplants him into something like an STF. With that broken up, Dorado hits a superkick into the shooting star press for the pin at 10:46. Rating: C+. Good stuff here, which shouldn’t be surprising. Ignoring the match though, while it was a low level idea, just having SOMETHING on this match made it feel more important. I can’t imagine this took more than ten seconds to put together and if they throw in a quick vignette or promo to pay it off next week, great. I can’t imagine it is that hard to ask the wrestlers to come up with some idea like this one and it at least made the match feel a tiny bit important. No it probably won’t last but I’ll take it. We recap Charlotte’s return, followed by her costing Asuka a title shot against Rhea Ripley. From Raw. Here is Charlotte for a chat. She is tired of the lack of respect from the women’s locker room. Wrestlemania was taken away from her and that just wasn’t fair. She can beat Asuka and Rhea Ripley on the same night, so tonight Asuka is getting taken out as Ripley sees what Charlotte can do. Cue Asuka and Ripley, with the latter being willing to take Charlotte up on her offer, even though Asuka is beating her tonight. Asuka goes to say something but Charlotte cuts her off and condescendingly reminds her of the Wrestlemania match. Asuka promises to beat her tonight, “b****”. I would pay a good bit of money to come up with any new way to present Charlotte other than the “I’m better than all of you” heel. And From Raw. Asuka vs. Charlotte Rhea Ripley comes out to watch as Charlotte grabs a headlock. They fall out to the floor in a heap though and it’s off to an early break. Back with Charlotte hammering away but Asuka scores with a knee to the face. A Shining Wizard (leg kick according to Virk, as the completely understandable learning curve continues) drops Charlotte but what looked like a Codebreaker completely misses. Thankfully commentary doesn’t try to hide it as they slug it out from their knees. Charlotte is up with a spear for two and then heads to the apron. Asuka’s kick to the ribs is blocked and Charlotte wrenches on the knee as long as she can. Back in and the Asuka Lock sends Charlotte to the ropes so she takes Asuka’s bad leg out again. The Figure Eight goes on but Ripley breaks it up, meaning the fight is on. Asuka kicks Charlotte in the arm and crucifixes her for the pin at 9:16, though Charlotte’s shoulder was a bit off the mat. Rating: C+. I know Charlotte loses here and it seems to set up Asuka vs. Ripley II, but come on. You know Charlotte is getting in that title match because that is what Charlotte does almost every single time. It’s going to happen no matter what and it wouldn’t shock me to see her win the title again. I would certainly hope not, but it isn’t like it would be unprecedented. Post match Charlotte yells at the referee and beats him down, even continuing as other referees come out to yell at her. Overall Rating: C+. I liked the original stuff more than usual (because it had a little bonus for the first time in….well years) but the rest of the show just brought up how dull Raw has been. The big Charlotte features at the end were hard to watch and the only saving grace is that it isn’t Mandy Rose/Dana Brooke vs. Nia Jax. Reigns and Cesaro could be interesting though and that alone puts Smackdown above Raw. It’s a bad time in WWE right now, and given that Wrestlemania was less than two weeks ago, that should be rather scary.     Remember to follow me on Twitter @kbreviews and head over to my Amazon author page with 30 different cheap wrestling books at: http://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Hall/e/B00E6282W6 AND R emember to check out Wrestlingrumors.net for all of your wrestling headline needs .\n",

      "Don’t take the p*** out of Tony Blair’s mullet – he doesn’t look like Pat Sharp, I fancy him more than ever… it’s sexy. FORMER PM Tony Blair sported a silvery mullet on telly - and viewers were left in stitches, comparing him to children’s TV presenter Pat Sharp and late club owner Peter Stringfellow.  The ex-Labour leader, 67, was making a serious point on ITV about Scottish independence — but online wags were more interested in his hair. 5 Blair stunned viewers with his locks  The ex-Labour boss, who left office in 2007 and handed over to Gordon Brown, showed off his long grey do during an interview - leading to one person quipping “It’s not Tony Blair, it’s Tony Hair.” Another said: “I think Pat Sharp has some serious competition.” But one woman who was left swooning after spotting the ex-PM’s swishy locks was mum-of-two and writer Hannah Verdier, 48, from south London.“He looked hot,” she says. Now Hannah explains exactly why she fancies 'Tone'... 5 Hannah has confessed how much she fancies Blair Credit: Supplied  AS soon as I saw Tony Blair on ITV earlier this week my heart skipped a beat. No, not because of what he was saying (to be honest I wasn’t really paying attention) but because of his hair.  Other people might have been taking the p*** out of his silvery grey mullet which resembled Pat Sharp’s locks, but I was utterly charmed. He looks fantastic, like a man in his prime. Cherie - you’ve got a love rival. Hair haters are gonna hate, but at 67 the Labour legend can still get away with the kind of hairdo Harry Styles would be proud of.  5 Tony during his number 10 heyday Credit: Times Newspapers Ltd  His new barnet is a style statement, not the result of shirking a long-awaited visit to the barber’s and it’s one that makes him look hotter than ever. Back in the early noughties, Tony turned heads when he and his rippling beach bod were named Heat magazine’s Torso of the Week, a prestigious accolade usually reserved for the likes of Daniel Craig.  But he’d already turned my head. He was the Rishi Sunak of his day, with hotness and power oozing from every pore.  You knew you were in safe hands with Tone, in more ways than one. As a trembling young reporter I once sat next to him on the Downing Street sofa while I gave him a grilling for a teen magazine and it’s only now that I can finally come out and tell the truth: he was hot - and his greying locks which have been cruelly compared to the late Peter Stringfellow’s just make him hotter. He looks fantastic, like a man in his prime.  Cherie - you’ve got a love rival. Hannah Verdier 48  Tony was always perfectly dressed and in control, he had Noel Gallagher on speed dial and you just knew that he and Cherie weren’t afraid to rumple their John Lewis quilt cover.  The fact that Andrew Scott - who played the Hot Priest in Fleabag -  is lined up to play him in The Crown is perfect casting.  Strong and sexy, both are men who’d hold your gaze for a second too long. In a good way. If reports and memoirs are to be believed, Tony and Cherie enjoy a marriage packed with hot lovin’, but if by any chance he was ever on Tinder there would be no shortage of right swipes for the silver fox.  His hair is evolving into something that will help him stay sexy into his 70s, a la Mick Jagger or Jeff Bridges.  5 People compared Blair's locks to the late Peter Stringfellow's Credit:  - Getty  Technically, it’s not even a mullet because it’s not short on top – it’s just flowing.  And come the summer, he can even rock a headband or man bun. It’s been a lean year for fun and all we’ve had to rely on for eye candy at teatime is Government briefings.  Would you rather enjoy a heated political debate with Matt Hancock, who at 42, is 25 years Tony’s junior but would never take a risk with his boring follicles?  Blair came to power in his 40s and maybe it was the Spice Girls soundtrack, the joy of Euro ‘96 or the air of optimism, but he looked a lot younger and hotter than today’s starched rabble.  You just knew that he and Cherie weren’t afraid to rumple their John Lewis quilt cover. Hannah Verdier 48  So it’s only right that he now embraces the grey and lets his hair flow. I bet Cherie loves it! This is the hair of a man who still has the ability to surprise his woman after all these years. The kind of hairdo that keeps calm in interviews but then is ready to party the moment it spins around. You don’t need an opinion poll to tell you the bare facts: the more a man pays attention to his style, the hotter he’s going to be in bed.  Talking of which, it’s a funny old week when the hair choices of one politician can eclipse another’s attempt to get other people to pay for his new curtains, but here we are. Blair has taken the art of the silver fox to the next level. 5 Watch out Cherie - Hannah's in town Credit: Splash News  Live Blog RAGING PRINCE Meghan's 'beyond the pale attack on Kate Middleton was William's final straw' MYSTIC MEG April 30: Your gift is juggling all the different aspects of yourself HILL WE GO Edinburgh couple trek 30km and 40k steps conquering seven hills TikTok challenge LONG LAST LOVE I'm 27 & never been kissed or slept with someone - I’ve never come close grubs up Scots hotel launch 29-minute breakfast challenge with HUGE plate of food OPEN MINDED Meet other stars who shun monogamy as Willow Smith comes out as ‘polyamorous’ Meanwhile this Line of Duty fan confessed she was hot for Supt.

Nornickel plans to adopt a new ecology strategy in 2021, where investments will exceed $5.5 billion, the company’s white paper, a report on the fuel spill in May 2020, reads. On April 29, the company published an annual sustainability report, which outlines the Norilsk incident’s chronology, clean-up and response, as well as various studies which the company organized after the accident, and plans for ecology and social events and internal changes. Nornickel has drafted an ecology strategy, which the Board of Directors may adopt within 2021, the company said. According to the document, Nornickel plans investments of $3.6 billion in cutting emissions, $1.1 in preservation of water resources, $0.6 billion - in reducing damage from tailing and waste dumps, $0.3 billion - in rehabilitation of all land affected by construction and mining. Nornickel will also invest in efforts to fight climate change and preserve biological diversity (investments to be determined within 2021). \"On 29 May, 2020, a diesel fuel storage tank at HPP-3 of NTEK JSC in the Kayerkan District of Norilsk failed due to unsealing, with 21,200 tonnes of fuel flowing out of the tank, going beyond the bunding, and getting into the pit, on the adjacent area, and into the Bezymyanny Stream,\" Nornickel’s document reads. \"Further through the Bezymyanny Stream and the Daldykan River, the spill reached the Ambarnaya River, where it was contained by protective booms, which prevented the diesel fuel from getting into Lake Pyasino.\" The company was charged with damage to the environment and has paid fully the fine of 146 billion rubles ($13.4 billion).  About company  Norilsk Nickel is the world’s largest producer of refined nickel and palladium and a leading producer of platinum, cobalt, copper and rhodium.

      "U.S .Stocks May Give Back Ground In Early Trading. (RTTNews) - After ending the previous session mostly higher, stocks may move back to the downside in early trading on Friday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by 172 points. Profit taking may contribute to initial weakness on Wall Street after the upward move seen on Thursday lifted the S&P 500 to a new record closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also reached a record intraday high during yesterday's trading but pulled back and ended the session only modestly higher. A steep drop by shares of Twitter (TWTR) may weigh on the markets, with the social media giant plunging by 13.4 percent in pre-market trading. The nosedive by Twitter comes after the company reported better than expected first quarter results but provided disappointing guidance. On the other hand, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are likely to see initial strength after the online retail giant reported first quarter earnings that far exceeded analyst estimates. Early negative sentiment may be partly offset by a report from the Commerce Department showing personal income skyrocketed in March amid the distribution of another round of stimulus checks. The Commerce Department said personal income soared by 21.1 percent in March after plunging by a revised 7.0 percent in February. Economists had expected personal income to spike by 20.3 percent compared to the 7.1 percent slump originally reported for the previous month. The report also showed personal spending jumped by 4.2 percent in March following a 1.0 percent decrease in February. Personal spending was expected to surge up by 4.1 percent. Just after the start of trading, MNI Indicators is scheduled to release its report on Chicago-area business activity in the month of April. The Chicago business barometer is expected to edge down to 65.0 in April from 66.3 in March, but a reading above 50 would still indicate growth. The University of Michigan is also scheduled to release its revised reading on consumer sentiment in the month of April. The consumer sentiment index for April is currently expected to be upwardly revised to 87.5 from the preliminary reading of 86.5, which was up from 84.9 in March. Stocks showed wild fluctuations over the course of the trading session on Thursday but managed to end the day mostly higher. With the upward move on the day, the S&P 500 ended the session at a new record closing high. The major averages all closed in positive territory, although the Nasdaq underperformed its counterparts. While the Nasdaq edged up 31.52 points or 0.2 percent to 14,082.55, the Dow climbed 239.98 points or 0.7 percent to 34,060.36 and the S&P 500 advanced 28.29 points or 0.7 percent to 4,211.47. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index and China's Shanghai Composite Index both slid by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged by 2 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.3 percent and the German DAX Index is up by 0.4 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are tumbling $1.48 to $63.53 a barrel after jumping $1.15 to $65.01 a barrel on Thursday. Meanwhile, after falling $5.60 to $1,768.30 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are inching up $1.60 to $1,769.90 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 108.96 yen versus the 108.93 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.2083 compared to yesterday's $1.2121.\n",

      "Originally posted by Pharmagang: ↑ Alright team, what an awesome day. This was a huge derisk in a single announcement. This had one of the biggest question marks around it. The results of the ARDS trial weighed heavy on a lot. Let's acknowledge how big a deal this is, a huge (75% reduction in mortality of Rem-l+Dex relative to Dex alone) (43% reduction in mortality in their own right) deal. That is a 75% improvement on the standard of care for a disease that is killing >800 people in the US per day, reducing mortality to just 12% from 43%. This clearly shows that Rem-L is an effective treatment against Covid-19 ARDS, which is clearly still a massive unmet medical need. Not only does it show this, but the FDA now has:RCT data for safetyRCT data for biomarkers (ie. mechanism of action)RCT data for a strong signal of efficacy (26% vs 42%, p=0.048 alone; 14% vs 45% in combination with Dex, p=0.006) for a cytokine-syndrome-like diseaseWhy do I point this out? Rem-L is also under review for regulatory pathways to market in GvHD. This gives gold standard (RCT) data on all of the above for Remestemcel-L, this data - as SI alluded to in the CC - will aid in FDA discussions regarding the best path forward for GvHD. The FDA could have even agreed to hold out to review this data prior to making a binding decision on GvHD - that would explain the delays. It's not the same disease, but you know, we have some pretty clear efficacy (shown by a met primary endpoint) to show we treat GvHD. For people who aren't too familiar with stats and p values, that means that there was a 48/1000 and 6/1000 chance that this data could have happened by chance, respectively. I'm happy with those odds, as will most people - including the FDA as p<0.05 is the standard for significance. I saw one dude be like \"Yea but they only just got under .05, this doesn't give me confidence\" - I die a little reading this. You are saying that less than a 50/1000 chance of this happening by chance is insufficient evidence for you to back this result? What about the 6/1000 as a combination therapy? How many times do you need to run into a concrete wall before you finally believe it's a dumb idea? smh Also, addressing EUA, this is definitely on the cards - but thank god MSB seem to be becoming more conservative in their estimates and saying 'another trial' right off the bat. The 4th point is demonstrated by the massive improvement on top of the current standard of care - Dexamethasone. Who knows, but we certainly have a worthy application.So looking forward, things we know:Surg Centre, no doubt under an NDA to allow for a complete review of the internal functioning of the company, put down US$110 million at 2.30. (Means there are probably no shady dealings considering they appointed a SurgCentre official to the board.)Novartis held out to review data for ARDS before deciding on the next stepsEach of the pursued indications by the company reflects massive market opportunities.Things I consider almost certain:Gruenthal European partnership money and trial initiation for CLBPNovartis partnership money and trial for ARDS (After being told that the trial failed, what results could you possibly hope for other than what we got?A statistically significant lasting reduction in mortality up to 60 days that synergistically works with the SoC and a reduction in discharge time. Considering they stayed on following the trial, I don't believe in the face of this kind of data that Novartis would walk - that would be insane. The CEO of Novartis even gave us a shout out shortly after 1:24: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vasnarasimhan_leadership-reimaginingmedicine-results-activity-6792709292706295808-T5Ah/?fbclid=IwAR2-ziNWC_0--gMvWtEgmrveilJmemoS25V-lWEdVtcYdMEenIGwvVm4Khk)Further SP gain on analysis of secondary markers from ARDS trial (similar to in January with the CHF results)Progression of Tasly partnership in ChinaEventual CHF partnership for US/EU commercialisation of RexlemestrocelThings I consider moderately risky:GvHD commercialisation has been massively derisked for the reasons highlighted above - but everything the FDA did with this one was weird so what's to stop them now. I think more likely to get conditional approval than not but that's just imo based on the new evidence presented by the ARDS RCT.CHF requiring a single trial. Coin flip tbh. We certainly have the data to validate it, but FDA wild card makes it too hard to call. Regardless, I strongly believe we will get a lucrative partnership prior to commercialisation.CLBP requiring a single trial. Ditto, coin flip but I think CHF is slightly more likely to land the right way up.EUA for Covid ARDS. We tick all the boxes, and the pandemic calls for it, but they're not given lightly. Is this the path to approval for the first approved commercial stem cell therapy in the US?All just my thoughts and not investment advice, I did top up though - following my own thought process.

Quote from: BIN-BIN on Today at 07:45:23 AMSince gold is more stable for long-term holding, investors will prefer to go for gold against bitcoin.Bitcoin is new, just a decade-old currency, but gold has been around for so many years over 100 years. So the two can not be compared, but again bitcoin has grown magnificently, so it offers quick returns.In my opinion, not all investors choose Gold for long-term investments, because if we really want quick returns, we should prefer Bitcoin.As we all know the volatile Bitcoin price can generate a much greater profit than Gold, but indeed the risk is also much higher. So for investors who are looking for it to be safe, they definitely prefer Gold over Bitcoin. So in the end back to each of us, because I prefer quick returns I prefer investing in Bitcoin. And it is proven that I managed to get a large profit from Bitcoin this year, because the increase in Bitcoin this year is very significant when compared to Gold.\n",

      "[Continue to write more stories about spring and enter the new national-level special economic zone] Haikou Yaocheng’s old appearance has changed, and rural revitalization has entered the fast lane. China Net, April 29 (Reporter Tong Mingyue) A half-hour drive from Haikou City to Yanfeng Town, where there is a modern &quot;Xanadu&quot; called Yaocheng. Yaocheng Hand-painted Guide Map Photo by Tong Mingyue on China Net. The ancient village of Yaocheng is one of the famous historical and cultural villages in Haikou, with a strong cultural gene. Walking here, surrounded by greenery, beautiful scenery, coupled with a modern urban atmosphere, it is like an idyllic urban scene. Once, this was a wasteland, but now the old village has a new look. On the basis of preserving the original rural appearance, restore the architectural style of Qiongbei residential houses with &quot;swallowtail dragon ridge, golden mountain silver bow, gray wall and blue tile&quot;, and reshape a brand-new modern beautiful home through artistic design. Comparison of the transformation of the three cups of tea yards in Yaocheng. Photo by Tong Mingyue on China Net. Yaocheng’s strategic planning is guided by party building, through the co-construction and co-governance and sharing of &quot;government infrastructure, state-owned enterprise industrial investment, rural resource sharing, and farmers’ dividend guarantee&quot; The new model of beautiful village construction will build Yaocheng into a beautiful homeland with orderly ecology, harmonious integration of fields and courtyards, and interdependence between enterprises and people, and promote the highland of cultural and creative brand building in Jiangdong New District, Hainan. Let high-quality life go from the city to the countryside. Bring high-end lifestyles into the countryside, so that people in the countryside can also experience the exquisite life of the city. At the same time, the return of resources allows agricultural products from the countryside to enter the city. Promote development with industry and promote the economic layout of Jiangdong New Area. Chen Tong, the mayor of Yanfeng Town, said: &quot;Prosperous industry, livable ecology, civilized rural style, effective governance, and affluent life are our overall goals.&quot; Steadily and steadily, adapt to local conditions, create a joint development of industry, talents, and culture, and jointly revitalize Unique advantages. The interior view of the homestay was taken by Tong Mingyue on China Net to teach him how to fish. It is better to teach him how to fish. When Yaocheng was first built, the goal was &quot;Party building to lead and rural revitalization&quot;, but how to implement party building work to the end is how to get the people to accept, recognize, and support the biggest problem. Wu Panlong, Chairman and Secretary of the Party Committee of Hainan Haikong Beautiful Country Construction Co., Ltd. said: &quot;In the process of the early demolition, dealing with the people really has to sink down, squat in the fields, and communicate with the people heart and heart. &quot;Promote the development of the villagers. How to benefit the people in rural construction requires not only the government&#39;s macro-control, but also the methods and methods used by enterprises to implement them. First of all, letting the common people have a guaranteed income is a key element, and the village collective &quot;rent + dividend&quot; model is adopted. At the same time, let the ordinary people participate effectively, provide corresponding re-employment opportunities and positions, and encourage local farmers to actively participate in the construction of the project, forming a benign and sustainable industrial chain. Taking advantage of the construction of Hainan Free Trade Port and seizing the opportunity of the times when both opportunities and challenges coexist, Yaocheng will act as a good Hainan based on the general requirements of rural revitalization of &quot;prosperous industry, livable ecology, civilized rural style, effective governance, and affluent life&quot;. The free trade port is a &quot;vanguard&quot; of rural revitalization. Green water and green mountains are Jinshan Yinshan. Yaocheng is an excellent experimental field on the road of rural transformation. It seizes opportunities in the development, finds its own position, uses its unique advantages to gain momentum, and explores its own pace of development on the road of rural revitalization.\n",

      "Hugging and going into pubs among rules changing from May 17. Kent hotels, museums, and cinemas will finally be allowed to reopen We are just over two weeks away from the next easing of restrictions in England. After hairdressers, gyms, shops and restaurants all reopened on April 12 the next benchmark will see even more significant changes. It’s the latest step on the roadmap out of lockdown which could see all restrictions lifted by June 21. May 17 will be the first day that two households are able to meet indoors for the first time since Christmas. At present, if only two households are meeting there is no cap on the number of people attending, but they must meet outdoors until May 17. As well as the mixing of households indoors from mid-May, indoor hospitality will also be allowed to reopen, alongside museums, cinemas and hotels. These measures will be the third part of the reopening from lockdown. From mid-May, groups of up to six people and two households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has given the go-ahead for family members to hug each other from May 17, although he maintained people should stay \"cautious\" until then. As part of this next stage of the reopening, weddings, receptions, wakes, funerals, and other life events such as christenings can be attended by up to 30 people. While pubs and restaurants can only serve customers al fresco at present, they will be able to open their doors in earnest from May 17. The rule of six and allowance for two households to meet will be introduced indoors as well, so two families can meet for a pub lunch inside. Meanwhile, these rules will no longer apply outdoors, when people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 in beer gardens or when dining outside. Hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and indoor gym classes will be allowed to open in this third phase of the reopening. Entertainment venues such as cinemas and theatres will reopen as well, with specific rules in place for venues of different sizes. Outdoor events will be permitted to open for whichever is smaller: up to 4,000 people or half of the venue capacity Indoor events will similarly be allowed to open for whichever is lower: up to 1,000 people or half the capacity. Meanwhile, for huge outdoor seated events, such as matches at Wembley Stadium, there is a limit of up to 10,000 attendees or a quarter of the capacity, whichever is lower. International holiday travel will be permitted from May 17, with a traffic light system in place that classes countries as red, amber or green on travel lists. For those travelling to countries on the amber or red lists, passengers will be required to quarantine upon return to the UK. Holidaymakers will only be able to return if they have a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of departure and will also be required to have at least one test after arrival in England. Travellers will have to purchase and take gold standard PCR tests upon their return to the UK - which come in at around £120 each and could rack up quite an extra cost for families. Yet, after Covid-19 testing firms were accused of profiteering, the government is reportedly considering plans to exempt PCR tests from VAT, which means costs could fall to around £50 per test. Also as part of the third phase of the reopening from May 17, university students will be able to return to in person teaching on campus, replacing virtual lectures. The fourth stage of the roadmap out of lockdown, which will come into force no earlier than June 21, should see \"all legal limits on social contact\" removed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed the dates set will not be brought forward. The reopening measures will go ahead on the proposed dates as long as the corresponding coronavirus data does not take an adverse turn. The four statistical areas which will determine the speed of the reopening are the vaccine roll-out, the Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations, the Covid-19 case numbers and the emergence of new variants. As of April 28, a total of 33,959,908 people have received one dose of the vaccine, with 13.6m people having received both jabs.\n",

Will get the other removed as duplicate:hey @Bazz88 and @stezzGood thread for this discussion stezz.I've had a chance to jump on GeoResGlobe to have a look at the tenements around. I went through holders of all the permits/applications around us on this results page:I couldn't see the one I was thinking of, so did a google search and found Sipa Resources, which is who I had in mind and had previously referenced us for their applications, which were immediately to our south/south west and within the inferred boundary. Interestingly, it appears that they no longer hold those tenements, or the applications were refused. Looking at the relevant page from their 2019 annual report, with their applications at the time, it actually looks we've picked up a part of them in our recent applications, see 27819, 27820 and 27821. Now I wonder what Sipa were thinking after seeing the CSIRO hydrogeochem?????Sipa and then a couple of other neighbours following:Sipa Resources:https://sipa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sipa-Resources-Annual-Report-2019.pdfEPM 27210 (and 25779, 27290)Touchstone ResourcesThis is a subsidiary of Metallica Minerals, which is the project @stezz referred to in the other threadhttps://www.metallicaminerals.com.au/esmerelda-projectEPM 27264This is particularly interesting to me.MRG Resources, private vehicle of geologist Rob Heaslop. Rob is consultant geologist to Inca Resources (ICG:AX) and, together with Dr Jonathan West, put together some sensational tenements in the East Tennant area, subject area of recent Geoscience Australia and Minrex studies and releases. I believe it is going to be a very hot province, like I expect for Empress Springs and for the same reasons - big, deep structures (under some cover) tapping the mantle with criss crossing substructures. I think Rob is probably a gun, didn't know him before buying into ICG (and also SER in that area) but he has nailed great ground that he vended to them. I must say what he's targeting in the Croydon area looks very interesting and has been optioned to North Queensland Resources, private company who have a brilliant team, this could be one to look out for when it comes up for listing someday.https://www.nqr-australia.com/teamThe relevant page on Rob's website:http://www.mrgresources.com.au/projects-william-rogersHis selected anomaly certainly stands outAlso last of all Crater Gold, who are further to the north and also referenced by Sipa, see map in Sipa snip.http://www.cratergold.com.au/irm/content/polymetallic-project.aspx?RID=310&RedirectCount=1They've been in that area for well over a decade and it's more part of the original Croydon fields as I see it.\n",

      "Li Juxin: After the correction of gold, it continues to fall, and gold trend analysis and operation suggestions. On April 30, there is currently no obvious trend in the short-term cycle. The U.S. Index tends to stabilize the wave and pull up, but the bullish trend of the gold 4-hour cycle does not change, and the short trend fails to form, so it will not directly fall. The trend is uncertain and the long and short rhythms change back and forth. In the operation layout, it is necessary to wait patiently for the support and resistance to be touched, and seek stable opportunities for the layout. Today&#39;s market is analyzed from the following points: 1. The market&#39;s high and low points continue to move downwards, and the short-term trend is weak; but the daily yin and yang alternate, which is an obvious shock signal; the 4-hour cycle is not broken at 745, and it is still in a bull trend. Different cycles and strengths give different signals. The market is in a state of contention between longs and shorts. You should not rush to chase up or down, but focus on resistance to support high, low, and low. 2. From the perspective of the graphic form, 1798-1796-1790 above forms a downward trend line, and the resistance is near 1788; at the same time, the resistance of the golden section of 1790-1756 is 0.764 at 1783. The most important resistance range that the market pays attention to is 1782-1788. When it touches this area, it is short, stop loss is 1792, and the profit target is 1774 and 1768. 3. The main support of the market is at 1752, which is the trend line connection of 1769-1763-1756. The line support is again the 1.382 position of the golden section of 1790-1763, but the shock market will not touch 1752 unless the price wants to choose the direction of the market. In the short term, we first focus on the support of the 1760-1764 area. When it comes to considering short-term and long-term, stop loss is 1754, and the profit target is 1774 and 1780. In summary, gold adopts a high-altitude, low-to-multiple layout during the day. Reached 1782-1786 empty, stop loss 1792, take profit 1774, 1768; touched 1762 short long, stop loss 1754, take profit target 1774, 1780\n",

      "Great Green Wall promises better lives to African farmers. By Richard Wetaya Once complete, it will reportedly be the largest living structure on the planet, covering an area 8,000 km long by 17 km wide – three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef – and stretching across the entire continent. With the fresh infusion of funds – obtained at the Paris-One Planet Summit for Biodiversity – it is anticipated that hard-pressed pastoral and agricultural communities long challenged by poverty and persistent food insecurity in the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions will enjoy better lives. Diarra Fatoumata, a 38-year-old mother of four, is from one of those farming communities – Koremairwa village in the Doutchi District of southwestern Niger. She is one of many smallholder farmers who recently received improved millet and maize seeds, courtesy of the initiative. “My farming prospects have gotten better on account of using improved grain seeds,” she said recently. She elaborated: “Previously, some of the seeds I used to plant would germinate but the crops would wither and die off. With the new seeds, I am now able to produce and harvest sturdier crops, which have a better market value. “Together with other smallholder farmers from my village and other areas of the Sahel, we have also attained training on appropriate crop rotation and how to use small-scale irrigation for crop production and for extending farming activities into the dry season.” For good measure, a number of smallholder farmers in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti were also trained in proper agroforestry, water harvesting and irrigation practices and on how to create shelterbelts for their farmlands. “Shelterbelts are now helping many farmers in controlling soil erosion in Sudan,” said Abdel Aldai, a wheat and maize farmer in Karima, Sudan. He added: “With agroforestry, we were taught how to integrate trees, which are helpful in climate change mitigation, into our farming activities, with an aim of achieving better productivity by tapping into the ecosystem amenities supplied by trees.” Agricultural and environment policy analysts reckon that the additional funding vouchsafed by the French government, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Commission and other sources will breathe new life into the initiative. The initiative has just under a decade to achieve its goals of creating 10 million green jobs, sequestering 250 million tonnes of carbon, restoring 100 million hectares of degraded land and protecting Africa’s biodiversity, while reducing poverty and food insecurity. Its mediocre progress to date was highlighted in a United Nations status report, Great Green Wall: Implementation Status and Way Ahead to 2030, released last year. The report found that the though the initiative was more than halfway to its 2030 completion date, it had only covered 4 per cent of its target area. The findings did make for good reading in some African ecological and environmental research think tank circles. “For some, it was an indictment on the people in charge of the initiative,” said Faustin Banjoko, a climate action and development policy expert. He added: “It also lent credence to schools of thought that held that zero net degradation and dryland tree planting (afforestation) in the 7 million square kilometers Sahel region would face long odds, as had been the case with the North African Green Dam project.” By all accounts, however, the initiative’s execution shortfalls were due to deficiencies in funding and technical support. Now those obstacles seem to be out of the way. Godfrey Oluka, an environment specialist at the United Nations Development Programme, said the new funding – in a year, that marks the beginning of the UN’s Decade for Ecosystem Restoration – may just be the silver lining the initiative needed. “It is a welcome development. It will hopefully draw forth a renewed urgency in executing the initiative’s targets – that is, the restoration of degraded land in the Sahel, a region that experiences a 3 per cent decline in agricultural production, per year, due to land degradation. The region has in the last 30 years been devastated by severe drought and massive loss of fertile land, due to climate change and over-farming, and the enhancement of agricultural production systems in the rest of the Great Green Wall (GGW) intervention zones, represented by Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mauritania and Djibouti,” Oluka said. Banjoko elaborated: “On the face of it, there is a lot of progress being made in the GGW nations especially in the areas of promoting agroforestry, improving livestock breeding, providing green jobs, creating shelter belts for farmlands, improving irrigation efficiency for agricultural production, strengthening climate resilience and boosting pastoral and agro-pastoral regenerative agricultural production. “These will, in the course of time, all translate into better incomes and a better food security status quo.” Because crop production in the Sahel is for the most part rain-fed with limited irrigated agriculture, several smallholding traditional agriculture farmers in countries like Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali have been getting apprenticeships on the improved use of sprinkle and drip surface irrigation techniques and on proper rainwater harvesting practices. There was further good news for farmers when the Green Climate Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development recently announced that they had a pipeline investment project called the Great Green Wall Umbrella Programme (GGW Up). It would ostensibly boost climate finance for the GGW nation’s rural populations and would ensure that small-scale farmers and agribusinesses have better access to markets and strengthened value chains, creating economic opportunities and jobs, through the development of climate-resilient infrastructure and expanding the use of solar energy. Speaking at the One Planet Summit, Susan Gardner, director of the UN’s Environment Programme’s Ecosystems Division, said the initiative was an inspiring example of ecosystem restoration in action. “This initiative alone will not transform the Sahel’s fortunes overnight but will rapidly become a green growth corridor that will bring investment, boost food security, create jobs and sow the seeds of peace,” she noted. In recent years, however, there have been growing concerns that the ongoing conflict in central Sahel would slow down progress, particularly in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. There are already grim realities on the ground with statistics from the International Organisation for Migration’s Displacement Tracking Matrix indicating that over 1.5 million people have been internally displaced by the ongoing crises in the three nations. Notwithstanding that, there are pointers to strides being made. During a recent International Forest Day Forward Thinkers Webinar, Louise Baker, managing director of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification Global Mechanism, said about 20 per cent of the project’s target area has now been completed. “All partners are working assiduously towards the initiative’s 2030 targets,” she said, adding: “Eighteen million hectares of the proposed 100 million land hectares have been restored, 350,000 green jobs out of the proposed 10 million have been created and about US$90 million generated by communities in the initiative’s intervention zone.” On the green economy front, the anticipation is that by the initiative’s completion point, 8,000 kilometers of the intervention zone’s land area will be covered with a mosaic of trees and plants. Thus far, more than 5 million hectares of degraded land have been restored in Niger and 12 million trees planted in Senegal. Some 15 million land hectares have been restored in Ethiopia; 29,602 hectares in Burkina Faso; 52,930 hectares in Eritrea, and 120 hectares of land in Mali, among other places. According to the UN report, land restoration in the project intervention zones positively impacted 15 of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By all accounts, the US$90 million generated helped to reduce rural poverty in the intervention zones. Baker is upbeat about the initiative’s prospects. “This initiative will not come up short like previous tree planting ecological projects on the continent. The difference is that it is owned and implemented by communities and countries themselves,” she said. She added: “Each country has designated a protected area dedicated to activities along the Great Green Wall, managed by their local communities. “A unique practice known as rainwater harvesting which collects the heavy annual rainfall and distributes it through irrigation systems, is one of the ways in which the Great Green Wall is sustained. Sustainability of this programme is already being owned by the communities.”\n",

      "Shi Jinyuan: Gold and Silver Soaring and Falling Markets and Latest Price Trend Operation Suggestions. Market trend analysis: April 30, gold news analysis: Thursday (4.29) gold technical: today&#39;s gold market is after the Asian market rushed higher and the entire European market fell, so the current market day is considered to belong Weak, but from the perspective of the trend, yesterday&#39;s price broke the high point of the rebound before the last decline in 1785, and there are signs of strengthening on the trend. But the key support is the 1762 position. If this position falls below, then the whole trend will reverse and become a very weak movement. However, regardless of the trend, in the case of intraday weakening, because the US is a rebound before the market, then the US The probability of a second dip after the market is relatively high. If the US market drops twice and breaks the current low, then it is a continuation of the short position. Today&#39;s US market operation is to consider rebounding and shorting. The current pressure on the top of gold is 1779-1781-1783, which are 382-0.5-618 after the intraday high of 1798 fell, and the high point of rebound after the first fall below 1780 in the European market is near 1782. , And the support below is the 1766 position, which is the starting point for the ascent of the 4-hour chart level yesterday, and the low point of 1762 yesterday. Gold today&#39;s suggestion is to go short in the 1781-83 area, stop loss at 1788, and target at 1773. Gold is currently uncertain whether the market trend is long or short. After all, after yesterday’s rise, today’s retracement is greater. If the retracement of this wave is lower than 1762, the next time it rises again, then the market is on the high side. Rising, the next time if it breaks the high point of 1789 today, then the 1800 will be at risk of breaking, and if today’s price retracement falls below the position of 1762 or after today’s decline, tomorrow will extend its downward trend to break the situation of 1762, then This is the reversal of the entire trend. After falling below 1762, the decline may be very large, in the 1730-1720 area. This is the general expectation. On the whole, today&#39;s gold short-term operation ideas suggest that the callback is mainly long, and the rebound short is supplemented. The top focus is on the first-line resistance of 1780-1785, and the short-term below focuses on the first-line support of 1740-1745.\n",

      "Treasure hunters hope to dig up 48 chests of \"Himmler’s gold\" buried in Poland. Treasure hunters from the Silesian Bridge Foundation have already established the supposed location of the German Nazi treasure. UK daily  The Sun  reported that the team is to begin excavating next week at an 18 th century palace in the town of Minkowskie in southern Poland. There may be up to 10 tons of gold and other riches to be found in 48 chests, worth more than EUR 547 million. The valuables were supposedly stolen at the end of the Second World War on the orders of the leader of the SS, Heinrich Himmler himself. Among the treasure, there is said to be jewelry belonging to German elites, who wanted to hide their valuables from the approaching Red Army, and the legendary “Gold of Wroclaw,” which had disappeared from the Wroclaw bank at the end of the war. The team from the Silesian Bridge Foundation examined documents that contained clues concerning the chests’ hidden location. These included a journal of an SS officer under the pseudonym “Michaelis” and a map received from the descendants of another German officer. An entry in the journal from March 12, 1945, discusses the treasure stash at the palace in Minkowskie: \"A ditch has been dug in the orangery, which is a safe 'home' for the delivered chests and containers.” The officer also described other hidden treasures, but the team decided to focus on the stash in Minkowskie palace because it was easily accessible. Another clue concerning the hidden chests was the letter of a German officer named von Stein to a woman who worked in the palace and later became his lover. “My dear Inge, I will fulfill my assignment, with God's will. Some transports were successful. The remaining 48 heavy Reichsbank chests and all the family chests I hereby entrust to you. Only you know where they are located. May God help you and help me fulfill my assignment,” von Stein wrote.\n",

The short-term decline will still face the impact of relatively dense technical indicators support prices. The hourly line shows that the short-term bottoming and reversal bring the hourly line technical indicators short-term upward and longer-term technical indicators form, forming a short-term gold cross-to-many guidance pattern. On the whole, today&#39;s short-term operation ideas suggest that the callback is mainly low and the rebound is supplemented by the high altitude. ===Thursday (April 29), international oil prices continued their upward trend, due to the bullish expectations about demand recovery this summer, which offset the new crown crude oil from India, Japan and Brazil. From a technical perspective, from a daily perspective , The market continued to rise on Wednesday and closed the positive line. Oil prices showed a trend of opening low and going high. The high price broke the previous high, and the low price did not break the previous low. There was an emerging trend. A big positive line was included to further break through the resistance level of the previous shock platform. Ma10 pierced MA30 to form a golden cross and diverged upward. The market once again stood above the previous adjustment cabinet. The overall performance was bullish, and short-term oil prices are expected to continue to rise. The hourly k-line rose on the Bollinger Band Middle Track and the 50 MA at the same time, and the Dayang Line rose strongly all the way. The Bollinger Band track obviously tilted upwards, the opening continued to increase, and the hourly line showed a clear bullish trend. On the whole, crude oil has basically recovered the decline of last week after confirming the bottom of the step back at the beginning of the week, and is currently showing a double bottom upward trend. On the whole, today’s short-term operation is suggested to focus on the low-to-many callback, supplemented by the high-altitude rebound.\n",
