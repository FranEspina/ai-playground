Shooter Dane Sampson has struck career-best form as he builds towards a third Olympics, setting a national record while winning the 50m rifle event at the South Australia championships. Sampson registered a score of 462 points to claim gold in the three positions event. The performance bettered Sampson's own national record of 460.7 points, which he achieved at last month's Wingfield grand prix.

It was a world-class finals score,\" Sampson said, having previously competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. \"You are unlikely to lose many competitions with that score. \"I definitely feel that I am getting better and better and I am tracking well for Tokyo.\" Sampson and other members of Australia's shooting team for the 2021 Olympics are set to come together for a pre-Games camp on July 4-19.

Originally posted by kervio: ↑ I think the update said median age of the first set of patients was around mid 50s and median age of the later set of patients was around 69, so they would have only had to have put the inclusion criteria in half way through the trial when the evidence was emerging that age was a huge factor in deaths in order to have a successful trial. This is the big \"what if\" that might have sent the SP to $10, FDA approval, lives saved etc.We can give them a pass on not knowing that up front for sure because of the speed in which the trial moved forwards on, but I think some reactivity would have saved the day here once more was known about covid (in the same way that we found out about comorbidities leading to higher rates of death).I disagree with this: \"This disease has been totally wacky in respect of different age cohorts, and no one has or has had any idea what is going to happen to any given age group once confronted with the disease or results/impact. COVID has everyone flummoxed.\" until the Brazil variant turned everything on its head (which happened after the trial) there was lots of clear evidence in white papers about the effect of age on covid mortality. The inclusion criteria is there to stop random chance from derailing your study, so if they had say 10 or so 80yo patients that were enrolled and bound to die no matter what it lessons the effect of your treatment on a saveable demographic within your cohort. I agree with your excitement on what the results though, and I think this therapy has some big potential to show effect and get approval in a confirmatory trial with appropriate design. It's better than I expected the results to be. Expand Hey,@kervio. Good points on age effect. I guess I was thinking more broadly, say in respect of MIS-C in kids, under-50s getting blood clots with the Astra Zeneca and J&J vaccines, etc. A lot about COVID has been very unpredictable.As well, we don't know what conversations, if any, were had between MSB, NIH, the FDA and the DSMB. Clearly, someone made the decision not to modify the inclusion criteria and continue the trial, opting to halt it, instead. Most likely NOT MSB's choice, and I doubt they would have been given enough information by the DSMB to allow them to make this call on their own. I am clearly not qualified to speak on the issue, of course!LeftYahoo had a good point about the silver lining here, though - we get the full trial results that much earlier, with it having been halted. Fingers crossed the NIH, the FDA and Novartis are as excited about these amazing results as we are!\n",

      "3. 14 Homegrown labels that are donating their profits to Covid-19 relief. In times of turmoil, fashion can seem frivolous.

      "5. #Newsmaker: Cassandra Wingrove heading up sales at Mickey Llew's Australian office. Performance marketing and SEO agency Mickey Llew recently appointed Cassandra Wingrove to lead growth and development at its Australian office. She has been tasked with developing and coordinating growth opportunities to reach the company’s sales objectives of $1.2 AUD (R14m). She will also provide broad operational day-to-day support to the team as the Australian offering and services were previously managed from the Johannesburg head office. Wingrove has a BA Degree in Communications and an Honours in Psychology from the University of Johannesburg and brings a wealth of experience gained from the digital marketing sector. Some of her core capabilities include forecasting the budgeting cycle, managing the financial reporting, developing online communication strategies and providing business intelligence. She says she’s excited to be joining the agency at such a crucial and dynamic period in its growth journey, with the Australian expansion. “I am thrilled to be joining Mickey Llew at such an exciting time as the business expands into Australia. It is also a very interesting time for digital with more opportunities than ever before. Will you be based in South Africa or Australia? I am based in Australia and have lived in Sydney for the past five years. What is your job title and what does your role entail exactly? Head of Sales. I am focusing on building the foundations of the Australian Office, through new client acquisition and also managing the day-to-day operations. We do also have plans to grow out the Australian team. How you plan to navigate the Australian office through these unusual times? These are challenging times around the world, however, a silver lining is that it has allowed certain industries to flourish, such as e-commerce. There have been more opportunities for agencies like Mickey Llew as SEO has never been so important, especially with travel being restricted. It has pushed consumers to discover local businesses nearby. What excites you most about the agency and the Australian office in part? The opportunity at hand. Mickey Llew has built a reputable name for themselves in the South African market by forming strong relationships with their clients, delivering bespoke services and achieving bankable results. This has laid a strong foundation to scale the business fairly quickly and will allow us to build out an Australian-based team. What are you most looking forward to or enjoying thus far? I am enjoying networking with other agencies and business owners. Tell us more about your background/experience and how this has equipped you for the role. I have been in the tech industry for the past seven years. Most of my time was spent at a global media intelligence company, which allowed me to be exposed to running new business processes across IMEA. I was then transferred to the company’s office based in Australia, where I worked across their key account clients. This gave me exposure to many Australian businesses across different industries. I have also been involved in a sideline business of selling on Amazon marketplace in the USA, which has given me a good understanding of some of the foundations that make up SEO, such as keyword research, product listing and running effective campaigns. What do you love most about your career? I love working in the tech industry because I believe in progress. People inevitably use technology to improve lives and help others. We spread knowledge, make tasks easier and make systems more efficient. Also, the industry is fast-paced and always evolving, meaning that there is always something new to learn. What’s at the top of your to-do list? To start building out our local partnerships with other agencies and businesses. What are you currently reading/watching/listening to? I love listening to podcasts whilst I exercise. As a mom of two little boys, the ability to multitask is an essential personality trait. I am currently listening to Kate Toon’s The Recipe for SEO Success, the Serious Sellers Podcast and SEO for the Rest of Us with Brendan Hufford. Tell us something about yourself not generally known? I have my Springbok colours for cheerleading. I competed in two World Championships held in the USA.\n",

      "1. Tokyo-bound Sampson sets Aust rifle record. Shooter Dane Sampson has struck career-best form as he builds towards a third Olympics, setting a national record while winning the 50m rifle event at the South Australia championships. Sampson registered a score of 462 points to claim gold in the three positions event. The performance bettered Sampson's own national record of 460.7 points, which he achieved at last month's Wingfield grand prix. The score was also notably higher than what Italy's Niccolo Campriani (458.8) and Poland's Tomasz Bartnik (460.4) produced to win gold at the 2016 Olympics and 2018 world championships respectively. \"It's good to be shooting PBs at this stage. It was a world-class finals score,\" Sampson said, having previously competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. \"You are unlikely to lose many competitions with that score. \"I definitely feel that I am getting better and better and I am tracking well for Tokyo.\" Sampson and other members of Australia's shooting team for the 2021 Olympics are set to come together for a pre-Games camp on July 4-19. The camp is intended to mimic the biosecurity bubble and strict protocols that await in Tokyo. \n",
